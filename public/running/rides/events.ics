SUMMARY:[France] Ascenders Team Asia Morning Group Run
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Come and join the Ascenders Team as we put on our running shoes
  and run\ndaily with our friends too by starting our day in a healthy way.
  Research\nshows that just 30 minutes of running can have huge benefits on
  your\nshort-term and long-term health. So we designed our running events
  to\nmotivate athletes to run 30 minutes each day to boost your metabolism
  and\nuse those calories. Running will also help you look good and feel
  stronger.\n\nOur group run is designed with runners of all levels in mind
  and set the\npace range to be determined by our Zwifter Runners. So find
  a group pace\nthat matches how you feel each day and make those steps
  count for you.\nRunners who went beyond the event duration will find that
  we have selected\ncourses that will help you earn the Route Badges when
  you run the full\ndistance.\n\nSo lace up those running shoes as
  everybody is welcome to join with our\nfriendly and motivating
  runners.\n\n# Join Ascenders Team on
