  time off\, or simply want a nice warm up or cool down session? Join us as
  we spend 30 minutes moving the legs in this slow-paced\, social event.
  The goal of the event is to encourage folks to move. \n\nThe leader will
  average 8kph (7:30min/km) // 5mph (12min/mile) for the duration and it is
  expected everyone will stay together. This is a timed event\, so we
  encourage runners to go at their own pace if the average pace is too fast
  and/or use a run/walk strategy.\n\n**Note: if you utilize a run/walk
  strategy\, please start with the walking portion so that you are not
  overrunning the group on each interval.**\n\nPut your black and orange
  tops and socks on and let's get moving!\n\nFacebook Group:
