SUMMARY:[France] ZLDR Progression Event 
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZLDR Progression Event. Today we’re going to
  do a progression run\, which basically starts a run at a slower pace and
  finishes at a faster pace than you started. So we’ll get progressively
  faster with each split. Progression runs help us build our endurance base
  but with less stress on our bodies than a typical interval or tempo run.
  This can help reduce the risk of injury. Plus it helps break up the
  monotony in our training.\n\nProgression running also will help teach you
  smarter pacing\, starting conservatively so you don’t burn out too
  soon. It also will help train your body to get used to pushing harder at
  the end of a race.\n\nThis event will start with a 10 minute warm up
  followed by 4 x 5 mins splits. The first split will be at 10k pace and
  each split will be a stair step up at +2%. Finally we will cool down for
  10 minutes. So let’s get those shoes laced up and ready to go!\n\nZLDR
  is a group of diverse people\, from speed demons to walkers\, from people
  just getting to their first 5k to ultra runners. We are here to support
  your on-foot dreams and help you develop your running/walking skills. We
  are a collective group of supportive and experienced runners and walkers
  who want to help you set and achieve new goals!\n\nFor more ZLDR fun and
