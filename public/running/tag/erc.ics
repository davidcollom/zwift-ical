SUMMARY:[Paris] Epic Run Crew: Thursday Thunder 
LOCATION:Paris
DESCRIPTION:It’s nearing the end of the work week. Perhaps it’s time to
  pick up the pace and go for it? Bring on the thunderous feet!\n\nThis is
  a 45 minute group run. You are welcome to run at your own pace (AYOP).
  Feel free to continue running after you finish the 45 minutes\, or end it
  early. It’s up to you.\n\nChatting is encouraged! Talk about food. Make
  a funny observation. Whatever. We don’t judge. Just have some
  fun!\n\nEpic Run Crew is based in Vancouver\, BC\, Canada. We were
  founded as an in-person club in 2021 and then joined Zwift in June
  2022.\n\nUse the Zwift Companion app to join the Epic Run Crew club\, for
  access to exclusive member-only group runs.\n\nFacebook:
