SUMMARY:[Watopia] MHG Run Club
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Back in January 2021\, Eddie Izzard ran 32 marathons in 31
  days. Our community rallied together and joined the action all month
  long. This inspired us to create the MHG Run Club\, which continues
  Eddie’s incredible efforts of making humanity great.\n\nThe MHG Run
  Club motivates and supports everybody\, whether you’re looking for tips
  to achieve your training goals or looking for a group to bond and
  socialize with. A light-minded Zwift treadmill runners group\, for
  runners of all abilities\, friendly chat and a good laugh :)\n\nPlease
  feel free to join me Clive Finnimore with our official MHG Run Club
  Lunchtime 5K @ 8KPH on Monday\, Wednesday & Fridays\, See you there soon
  :)\n\nPlease also join us on:\n\nFacebook:
