SUMMARY:[France] Film My Run 500 with NoblePro 
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Join Stephen Cousins and NoblePro for a 500 metre climb. Set
  your treadmill to 12% incline and run 4.2km of distance to reach 500
  metres elevation. If your treadmill doesn't go that high\, set it as high
  as it will go and join us anyway!\n\nThe run will be progressive starting
  at a walking pace of 5kph rising to 7kph for the final kilometre. Get on
  to the balls of your toes and get your calf muscles to do the work. This
  continuous uphill effort will help build strength and endurance for those
  hilly trail runs\n\nThis event is sponsored by the ever popular Noble Pro
