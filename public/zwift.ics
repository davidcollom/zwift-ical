SUMMARY:[Watopia] SYN Workout Hour
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Time to fire up those legs! Every Thursday the SYN Global
  Cycling Club brings you the SYN Workout Hour—a weekly session built to
  boost your fitness and keep you sweating with a smile. Each week we mix
  it up: sometimes it’s steady FTP-building grind\, sometimes it’s
  short sharp power blasts\, and other times it’s smooth aerobic work.
  Whatever’s on the menu\, you’ll come out stronger.\n\n60MIN NO DROP
  WORKOUT\nZwift keeps us together\, so you’ll hit your own FTP targets
  without getting left behind. Sessions are round 60 minutes of solid
  training\, warm-up to cool-down.\n\nUNLOCK THE SYNDICATE CLUB KIT\nFinish
  our High Intensity Sessions on Zwift and unlock the Inverted SYN Kit
  (black jersey\, white bib) in your garage\, so you can wear the colors of
  our cycling club in any other ride on Zwift.\n\nDISCOVER MORE IN THE SYN

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Macro to Micro
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nA zone 6 microburst workout with an
  initial longer effort to mimic the demands of a Zwift race start. ERG off
  for the micro efforts.\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC
  Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional
  Development and Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert
  level) Certified Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA
  Cycling certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe
  Sport Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is
  also the creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can
  be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Orange Unicorn
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nAfter a warm-up\, we will move into 2x
  (15 mins alternating between 2 mins @85% FTP\, and a 30 second surge
  effort (110+ RPM) @105% FTP).  We will be mixing up the cadence and
  position on the bike throughout the course of the workout as well to
  further challenge your basic skills and on-bike flexibility.\n\nWORKOUT
  DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in
  Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care\, is
  a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach\, a level 2
  certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling certified power based
  training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified\, and a
  licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's
  "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via 
  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on
  GC Coaching\, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP
  WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal
  event and once the event starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays
  together regardless of power output. That's right\, if you're outputting
  100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the
  same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall
  6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL
  HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated
  FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too
  high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Unknown] EVO CC Race Series
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO CC race series.  Start fast\, hang on in the
  middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to push your heart
  rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your training plan and
  watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as possible we have
  enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic disqualification
  on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate monitor\nRiding in an
  incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be disqualified in A\, B\, and
  C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D category. Race details and final

  20s (erg mode off for the sprint so you can give max effort) before
  settling back into threshold for the remainder. 4 mins easy soft
  pedalling\, riding super easy to recover in between.\n\nAfter the final
  recovery\, we go straight into 20/40s. Turn erg mode off so you can give
  max efforts for each 20s and then spin super light to recover for
  40s.\n\nCool down\, ride easy for 7+ mins to finish.\n\nThis session is
  to simulate both the hard start at the beginning of an Zwift race\,
  attacks during races where it’s a max effort followed by high a
  intensity effort\, before backing off to recover and then go again\, and

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[London] ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2. This is a group ride\,
  not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was
  founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW
  BEACON will pace between 1.7-1.9 on the ride \, with a possible increase
  of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for the whole ride
  will be sub 2 .\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our
  rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures
  that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back
  of the main group \, you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge
  the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride
  Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give
  you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are
  a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club \, but want you
  to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported
  and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader\, Sweeps and Ride
  Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not
  draft and will require you to push harder on the ride\, and in these
  instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes
  operate very similarly\, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be
  required for the ride and any chase backs to group .\n\nAll our rides
  have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have
  technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early
  stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the
  main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\n\nWe love to have a chat on our
  rides so join us on our dedicated discord channel for our sub
  2\nhttps://discord.gg/RJ3dhbjCEp\n\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the
  ride leader (or just in front on climbs)\, don’t let a gap form and the
  elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to fry
  anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE
  RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race

SUMMARY:[Unknown]  Hotchillee Gain Train 
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:What is it?\nFirstly\, IT’S NOT A RACE but that doesn’t
  mean it’s an easy pace no-drop ride. It’s a paced “Category +”
  Hare and Hounds where you will be working predominately at the upper end
  of your category and hanging on for as long as you can in search of those
  gains.\n\nWhat are the paces?\nPaces are based on what the Ride Leader
  for each group will average and our leaders are pretty accurate - check
  on ZwiftPower afterwards.   Buffet Class (D+) Leader will average 2.4
  w/kg (departs at 1830)\nSecond Class (C+) Leader average 3.1 w/kg
  (departs at 1834)\nFirst Class (B+) Leader will average 3.7 w/kg (departs
  at 1836)\n\nPlease do not push the pace faster than this\, it ruins it
  for everyone - respect your Ride Leader\, do what they ask and don’t
  sandbag.\n\nWill the groups catch each other?\nUsually we aim for there
  to be a catch/merge in the final 5km or so but this does depend on the
  course.\nIf a merge does happen\, stronger riders are encouraged to
  “upgrade” to the faster group and\, if you’re struggling\, you can
  also “downgrade” to a slower one.\n\nWhat if I get dropped?\nSuck it
  up\, maybe find someone to spin home with and try to hang on a bit longer
  next week - just like a IRL chain-gang\, that’s how you get
  stronger.\n\nCan I push it at the end?\nWith about 3km to go\, your
  Leader will give a Go! Go! Go! shout and then\, if you want\, you can
  empty the tank.\n\n  What is Hotchillee?\nHotchillee is both an
  events company that organises some of the world's best cycling events and
  a cycling community. Check out the website for details of events\, rides
  and to get involved www.hotchillee.com

  a fun a social handicap race where riders in each category (A\, B\, C\, D

  With the help of a coach on Discord we'll get you working seamlessly
  together. There can only be one race winner\, however\, so eventually it
  will be every rider for themselves across the finish line! This race is
  not part of the Glorious Cycling Club racing league and so there are no

SUMMARY:[France] ZLDR Progression Event 
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZLDR Progression Event. Today we’re going to
  do a progression run\, which basically starts a run at a slower pace and
  finishes at a faster pace than you started. So we’ll get progressively
  faster with each split. Progression runs help us build our endurance base
  but with less stress on our bodies than a typical interval or tempo run.
  This can help reduce the risk of injury. Plus it helps break up the
  monotony in our training.\n\nProgression running also will help teach you
  smarter pacing\, starting conservatively so you don’t burn out too
  soon. It also will help train your body to get used to pushing harder at
  the end of a race.\n\nThis event will start with a 10 minute warm up
  followed by 4 x 5 mins splits. The first split will be at 10k pace and
  each split will be a stair step up at +2%. Finally we will cool down for
  10 minutes. So let’s get those shoes laced up and ready to go!\n\nZLDR
  is a group of diverse people\, from speed demons to walkers\, from people
  just getting to their first 5k to ultra runners. We are here to support
  your on-foot dreams and help you develop your running/walking skills. We
  are a collective group of supportive and experienced runners and walkers
  who want to help you set and achieve new goals!\n\nFor more ZLDR fun and

SUMMARY:[Richmond] ZHCC RUBBERBAND SOCIAL
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Want a 100% guaranteed no drop ride? want a 100% guarantee you
  can ride at your own pace? want a 100% guarantee you WILL stay in the
  group\,? want a 100% guarantee that the nasty fence will NOT kick
  you...........THEN LOOK NO FURTHER\, this is the ride for you.\nTry it -
  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT!\nOur ZHCC Rubber Band Club has the
  “rubber-band” activated which means that no matter what level you
  are\, you will be able to keep up and the group WILL STAY TOGETHER. The
  rubber band allows you to ride at your own pace\, slow or fast and you
  are guaranteed to stay in the group.\nThe ride speed will be slightly
  less than you would normally experience in a group ride due to the rubber
  band effect\, but we feel that's a small price to pay to allow all level
  of riders to remain together throughout the ride.\nIn this supportive
  environment it’s a great way of completing a ride knowing you wont get
  dropped or get dragged along by those naughty fliers!\nZHCC do not race
  each other\, we ride as one\, have fun and enjoy a group ride.\nThe ZHCC
  gang look forward to riding with you.\nSTRAVA :

  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Spaded Sweetie
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nWe start off with a "spade" interval set
  off very hard\, but short\, and gradually reducing the intensity while
  upping the time\, only to go back up again!  From there\, we will move
  into a progressive over/under sweet spot interval featuring changes in
  cadence and intensity that culminates in a 1 minute FULL GAS effort! 
  This is a tough workout\, but features a lot of quality time at VO2 and
  Threshold and excellent training stress\, all in an hour!  You can do
  it!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors
  degree in Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient
  Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach\, a level
  2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling certified power based
  training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified\, and a
  licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's
  "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via 
  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on
  GC Coaching\, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP
  WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal
  event and once the event starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays
  together regardless of power output. That's right\, if you're outputting
  100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the
  same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall
  6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly
  recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be
  inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for
  your current fitness level. For more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[New York] UK Armed Forces Cycling Community Race Night
LOCATION:New York
DESCRIPTION:We are back being "in the chop" is an Aussie expression that
  you won't read about in the UCI rulebook. It's one of the many nuances of
  bike racing that only comes with experience.\n\nSometimes when you're in
  a race and find yourself in the final break-away bunch you might get
  asked "are we in the chop?" or "are we chopping it?". This is referring
  to collusion between the lead riders to work together until the finish.
  Many times a break-away will be doomed in the final kilometres because
  everyone starts playing cat and mouse\, attacking\, sitting up\,
  etc.\n\nBut all that goes out the window in the last lap. This is
  generally where the group comes together and the final push begins.
  Working together goes out the window and is every man or woman for
  themselves for the final sprint to the line.\n\nThe Chop is a flat fast
  time-based handicap race. Do you always get blown out the back on the
  start of a multi grade race trying to hang onto the guy going with A
  grade pushing 5w/kg. Well not on The Chop. Released in Grades there are
  time splits from D to A with the intention of all coming together at the
  end for the big finish. Each Grade wears a different Zwift kit making
  each grade easily identifiable on who's wheel you want to catch if they
  go past.\n\nRaces happen on Tuesday evenings. We plan to add further
  races in the future. No single race has been the same. Many variables are
  at play on The Chop including course (which is generally a flat course)\,
  race numbers\, and the inevitable sandbaggers. It has been called a team
  time trail and cat and mouse but the real racers know it only as "THE
  CHOP". Do you have what it takes to take the glory?\n\n\nUKAFCC

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Bonbon
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nThis is a great workout to do on a
  consistent basis as it works on muscular strength and endurance! We'll
  also keep a focus of high torque during the burst efforts
  today.\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a
  bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and
  Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified
  Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling
  certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport
  Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the
  creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be
  contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Paris] EVO CC Sprint Race Series 
LOCATION:Paris
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO sprintrace series. Shorter more compact races
  for the rider looking for an effective high intensity race. Start fast\,
  hang on in the middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to
  push your heart rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your
  training plan and watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as
  possible we have enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic
  disqualification on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate
  monitor\nRiding in an incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be
  disqualified in A\, B\, and C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D
  category. Race details and final results will be available at
  www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] GGCC Glasgow Green Cycle Club Thursday Training Ride
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:GGCC group rides are TRAINING events\, category C\, with a
  yellow beacon leader. The beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average
  wherever possible.\n\nPlease look out for our training rides 3 days a
  week\, every week - Tuesdays at 20.45 UTC\, Thursdays at 21.00 UTC and
  Saturdays at 11.30am UTC. Use #ggcc to search\, as in
  https://zwift.com/events/tag/ggcc\n\nThe Glasgow Green Cycle Club (GGCC)
  training rides are intended to provide a challenge for riders\, and are
  open to all timezones. You should ride as a group\, following the
  instructions of the beacon ride leader(s) for any sprints\, intervals and
  spicy segments\, regrouping after each when requested. All our group
  rides also have a closing minirace\, to start from behind the
  beacon.\n\nGGCC is a Glasgow based cycling club whose “in real life”
  (irl) club runs and training rides are always organized into pace
  groups\, which match the Zwift categories quite well. GGCC also has a
  good race pedigree and presence in Scotland\, and so we have organized
  this training ride series to suit what we believe is relevant to bike
  riders’ interests in performance and improvement in our club\, in other
  Glasgow clubs\, in Scotland and the UK. Racers will\, no doubt\, aspire
  to try our other events\, both our Monday 20.10 UTC Zwift races\, and our
  Friday 19.45 UTC TTs.\n\nAs we expect our club’s riders to be able to
  ride 50 miles at a 15mph average on our Sunday rides\, such steady riding
  members will be comfortable with Zwift Category C\, and in our various
  rides we cater for all abilities\, through the Zwift ABCD levels. Beacon
  leaders communicate via Zwift messaging (always) and/or Discord
  (sometimes) to vary the pace to allow for sprints\, intervals\, and
  optionally a mini-race towards the end of the rides\, with regrouping
  after each segment. Make as much use of drafting as you can\, for more
  effective sprinting and intervals.\n\nResults can be seen at the end of
  the ride on screen\, and we will\, in common with many other ride
  series\, publish your results on zwiftpower.com too\, based on each
  category.\n\nAll bikes and PUs are allowed\, but better not to use TT
  bikes (which don’t draft) on our group rides and races. Please add GGCC
  (X) to your Zwift name to allow your ride presence to be recognized\,
  where X is your desired ride category. Categories are related to your
  Functional Threshold Power (FTP)\; use your FTP and then divide by your
  weight in kg\, then pick the correct ride and group.\n\nC: 2 W/kg to 3
  W/kg FTP\; the beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average.\n\nPLEASE
  NOTE: Strava data for our rides must be open (not private or hidden).
  Please use a heart monitor so that we can monitor correlated power and
  heart rate to help assure fair riding.\nYou can use our Discord channel
  to talk to each other at https://discord.gg/UDhdEQA\nPlease see the GGCC
  Zwift page link at http://www.glasgowgreencycleclub.co.uk/ for

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Uphill Battle
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nUphill Battle starts off with 3 sets of 5
  minutes right below Threshold (95% FTP) featuring a 30 second ramp-up to
  finish (from 100% FTP to 150% FTP). After these\, we will be moving onto
  2 sets of 30/30s (30 seconds work\, 30 seconds rest). The first set is
  done at 130% FTP for the work interval and 70% FTP for the "rest". The
  second set ups the ante a bit to 140% FTP for the work interval and 60%
  FTP for the "rest". Do you have what it takes to finish it? I know you
  can!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a
  bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and
  Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified
  Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling
  certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport
  Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the
  creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be
  contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] The Grind Finale
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nThis session aims to replicate the
  demands of a mountain bike ride / event. \n\nMountain biking generally
  involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so
  plenty of surges and time spent being over geared! We also spend a lot of
  time on and off the power\, so short spells going  hard to get over an
  obstacle\, followed by a freewheel or very low power on a descent or
  little dip.\n\nWe touch upon all of these aspects in todays session\, as
  we start off alternating every 30 seconds between riding hard at a low
  cadence\, and riding easy - as if we are riding through an undulating
  single track. Then we make a ramp in effort\, which finishes with a 30
  second near max effort up a steep\, rocky banking!\n\nWORKOUT
  DESIGNER\n\nMatt Rowe - Heavily involved in cycling for the past 25
  years\, Matt represented Great Britain at the Junior World Championships
  before graduating to the pro ranks. Matt draws on his extensive race
  experience to help amateur cyclists around the world achieve their
  personal goals. \n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the
  starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts\,
  workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output.
  That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the
  FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty
  level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. For more
  info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] BMTR Faster Masters A/B/C Team Pursuit
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:From May through September\, the three category groups (A\, B\,
  C) may or may not include a Yellow Beacon Team Leader. \n\nTeam C will
  start first\, followed by Team B\, with Team A departing last. The goal
  is for the faster teams behind to catch Team C at or near the finish\,
  with all three teams holding their respective advertised pace. Starting
  time gaps may be adjusted during the season to ensure a close
  finish.\n\nThe pace efforts for each team are as follows:\n\n- Team C:
  2.5 to 3.1 watts per kilogram (w/kg).\n- Team B: 3.2 to 4.0 w/kg.\n- Team
  A: 4.1 to 5.0 w/kg.\n\nAll rides include a 30-minute Late Join period.
  During this time\, dropped riders can use the Late Join feature to
  rejoin. If you find that the team you selected is either too fast or too
  slow for your pace\, you can switch teams within the first 30 minutes of
  the start time of the team/category you would like to join..\n\nWe do not
  sweep during the first 30 minutes of a ride. If you fall behind for any
  reason during this time\, we recommend using the Late Join feature. We
  usually do not have designated sweepers (Red Beacon). After the first 30
  minutes\, if you get dropped and want to rejoin your team\, please send a
  message in the format HELP(X)\, where X is the number of seconds you are
  off the back (for example\, HELP5). If you reach out early\, one or more
  stronger riders may come to assist you.\n\nWe look forward to having you
  join us. It will be an excellent endurance adventure!\n\n**Connect With

SUMMARY:[France] RO4H "Aaahh\, Thursday!" Social Ride
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride.\n\nThe
  RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride is a social group ride hosted by
  the Ride On 4 Health community. We foster a friendly\, casual\,
  supportive\, and respectful atmosphere that embraces everyone from the
  most seasoned Zwifter to the first-time group ride participant.\n\nThe
  pace varies depending on the terrain\, but the ride will have an overall
  average pace of around 18–20 MPH (27–32 KPH). The pace on the flats
  sections will be slightly faster in the peloton and be sub 2 W/KG on
  climbs. We typically ride mostly flat routes with only a few short
  hills\, if any. Sometimes we take on some slightly hillier routes for
  variety\, but most of our rides will be gently rolling to flat
  terrain.\n\nWe try to be a no-drop ride\, but ultimately\, this pace is a
  recovery pace for some and a great effort for others. You should be
  prepared to meet the average pace and strive to stay in the ride leader's
  peloton to benefit from the group draft effect. Being a social ride\, we
  don’t chase flyers — but flyers are free to fly. The “Aaahh\,
  Thursday!” Social Ride is certainly not a race.\n\nSweepers are
  available to assist those off the back. We do not want anyone to ride
  alone unless they choose. The sweepers will variably help riders bridge
  to the leader's peloton or form a second pace group. We do not want
  riders to ride alone unless they want to.\n\nJoin us for the RO4H
  “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride —you'll almost certainly break a
  sweat\, hear a few dad jokes\, and might even have fun.\n\nView the RO4H

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

  group draft effect is kept under tight control with a target of 1.5w/kg
  on any hills or upslopes. The Leader will text instructions as well as
  use discord voice chat as communication is the key to a good group ride.
  Sweepers will also be in operation to assist in helping the group stay
  together as this is a non-drop ride.\n\nAll riders will appear in the
  same kit (unlocks at the finish) and you can optionally add (PACK) after
  your name to show support of the group. Please respect the pace set by
  the leader\, this is a group ride not a race.

DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:The Herd's Thirsty Thursday (THTT) Dual Pace Social Group
  Ride\n\nThis group ride offers a dual pace in a social environment. The
  goal is to keep our rides entertaining with games and trivia\,
  educational with Zwift tips\, and on pace. This ride offer our
  traditional Cat “D” option or a slightly higher paced Cat “C”
  option.\n\nOur ride leaders’ goal is to keep to the advertised pace\,
  averaged over the course of the ride. However\, bear in mind that there
  are situations such as incline and descents that will affect the pace. To
  this\, we ask that you pay attention to the rider leader announcements
  and adjust your pace accordingly. Stay close to the yellow beacon where
  the draft is most effective. As is customary to all Herd rides\, we offer
  full Yellow (Ride Leader) and Red beacon (Sweeps) support.\n\nIf you find
  yourself wanting more of a challenge\, we encourage you to join our sweep
  team as they ride “sweep-tervals” (above advertised pace) to help
  bring riders back to the ride leader.\n\nRiding alone is not an option\,
  as Herd rides are geared to be inclusive and fun.\n\n#herd

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] VO2 Max 40/20
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nToday\, we'll be aiming for around 16mins
  of VO2 Max time and incorporating a 40/20 interval approach which will
  challenge you for sure! Let's make it happen today! REMINDER: You can
  always adjust the FTP bias via the arrow keys on your keyboard\, or the
  Zwift Companion app. Once you get over threshold\, using a %FTP for
  workout prescription can get murky\, so always adjust as
  needed\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a
  bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and
  Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified
  Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling
  certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport
  Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the
  creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be
  contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the
  FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty
  level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. For more
  info on FTP go to:

  for your fitness pleasure! We'll mix it up today with position changes\,
  pedal stroke work\, longer threshold intervals\, and the dreaded "Shark
  Teeth'"efforts!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds
  a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and
  Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified
  Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling
  certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport
  Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the
  creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be
  contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

  questions about all things ZRL-related. You'll be able to learn useful
  course and team tactics and if you are new to ZRL - perhaps even find a
  team to race with too!\n\nThere are multiple Group Recon Rides to choose
  from each day at various times and each will operate at the advertised
  paces (pace is based on your Zwift Pace Group).\n\nWHAT IS THE
  ZRL?\nIntroducing the spectacular Zwift Racing League (ZRL) - a
  turbocharged online bike racing extravaganza that's rewriting the rules
  of competition. With a staggering 180 community divisions\, 1\,800
  electrifying teams\, and a whopping 14\,000 fierce racers per 6-week
  round\, the ZRL stands as the undisputed heavyweight champion of online
  bike racing competitions worldwide.\n\nThis high-octane spectacle is
  masterfully orchestrated by our powerhouse partners\, WTRL\, who leave no
  stone unturned in delivering an unparalleled racing experience. But
  remember\, this race is an invitation-only affair\, so if you dare to
  join the ranks of speed demons and thrill-seekers\, you'll need to hitch
  a ride with one of the esteemed existing teams. Fear not\, though\, for
  WTRL's website (www.WTRL.racing) is your portal to all the insider intel
  - schedule\, rules\, and even a team that perfectly aligns with your
  fiery spirit!\n\nIf you want to gather your own team\, you register for

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Anaerobic Capacity into VO2
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nBig session today! We open with 6 x 2min
  Anaerobic Capacity efforts\, however the target power increases from hard
  to very hard! The workout concludes with a 6min VO2 effort featuring the
  same steady increase in target power.\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nKevin
  Poulton - With more than 20 years experience coaching athletes at the
  World Tour level\, Kevin has spent the past two decades designing
  workouts and structured training plans to help cyclists achieve their
  goals. He’s coached countless athletes to wins in Grand Tour stages and
  one-day Classics\, including Mat Hayman’s 2016 Paris-Roubaix
  victory.\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area
  just like a normal event and once the event starts\, workout mode begins.
  Everyone stays together regardless of power output. That's right\, if
  you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will
  stay in exactly the same position relative to each other. Only if you
  stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding
  stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated
  FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too
  high for your current fitness level. For more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Arise
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nA Zwift race start specific workout with
  30/30s followed by 10min at zone 4\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney
  (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional
  Development and Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert
  level) Certified Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA
  Cycling certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe

  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Watopia] "Russian Step - Hamster Style"
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:“Russian Step - Hamster Style” is a cadence game where your
  legs spin like a hamster wheel! Alternate between high-speed spins
  (100–120 RPM) and controlled strength efforts (60–75 RPM). It builds
  coordination\, pedaling efficiency\, and muscle activation. Stay focused
  and flow with the rhythm. Let’s spin like warriors!\nThe “Russian
  Step - Hamster Style” workout is perfect for those aiming to improve
  cadence agility\, pedaling efficiency\, and neuromuscular responsiveness.

  segments\, it trains your body to handle sudden changes in rhythm and
  builds muscular coordination. It’s an excellent session for riders of
  all levels who want to break routine\, sharpen their pedal stroke\, and
  have fun while training. It also keeps the mind engaged and legs
  responsive.\n⸻\n\n        •        Warm-up (10 min):\n        •

SUMMARY:[Yorkshire] Ham Sandwich
LOCATION:Yorkshire
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nHam Sandwich features sweet spot
  over/unders\, with 30/30s sandwiched in between.  The over/under
  intervals alternate between 2 min @88% FTP and 30 secs @110% FTP.  The
  30/30s up the ante a bit and alternate between 30 secs @130% FTP and 30
  secs @50% FTP.  Yes\, there are rest breaks\, but they are purposely
  short to keep the heart rate and metabolic demands up.  Better eat your
  sandwich quick before the bread gets soggy...\n\nWORKOUT
  DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in
  Health Science in Professional Development and Advanced Patient Care\, is
  a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified Coach\, a level 2
  certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling certified power based
  training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport Certified\, and a
  licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the creator of Zwift's
  "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be contacted directly via 
  for any cycling or training related questions.\n\nFor more information on
  GC Coaching\, please visit www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP
  WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the starting area just like a normal
  event and once the event starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays
  together regardless of power output. That's right\, if you're outputting
  100W and another Zwifter is outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the
  same position relative to each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall
  6 meters behind the group will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL
  HINT\n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated
  FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty level of the workouts too
  high for your current fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:
