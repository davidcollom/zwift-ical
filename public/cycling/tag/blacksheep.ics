SUMMARY:[London]  Black Sheep Black Friday Workout
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:The BLACK FRIDAY WORKOUT\n\nIt’s always time for a workout
  ride somewhere! So we are flipping Black Friday on its head. We are
  Aussies\, after all. The Black Friday will be a morning workout for
  locals. A night before workout for Euro’s and somewhere in between for
  our friends in America.\n\nBlack Friday Workout is a pure social workout
  at its best. We usually end with a beer\, so let’s make it a coffee.
  And hey\, why don’t we throw in a new kit as well. Finish the workout
  to unlock your very own Black Sheep Racing Club kit in-game.\n\nJoin us
  for the Black Friday Workout each Friday at 6:30 am AEST.
