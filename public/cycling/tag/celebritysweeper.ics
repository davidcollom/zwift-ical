SUMMARY:[Richmond] Coffee Lovers High Time for a Third Place
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Have you heard of Third Place? \n\nWe are sure that most of us
  are attracted to Zwift not only because of the sporting side\, but also
  because of its social component. The opportunity to do something healthy
  not as a statistician\, logging kilometres and hours pedalling\, but at
  the same time enjoying communication\, laughing\, learning new things\,
  sharing emotions\, memories and experiences. So that the hour does not
  drag on endlessly. That the sublime taste of the combination of sport\,
  joy and endorphins inspires you\, making you want to come back again.
  \n\nLet this event be your Third Place!

SUMMARY:[France] Endura Renegades
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Time for some gravel. On the only Zwift course that currently
  offers any advantage to gravel bikes\, we head to the Makuri Islands for
  the Chain Chomper circuit. Of course\, it‚Äôs up to you if you still want
  to go for an MTB or Road bike anyway\, that‚Äôs your call\, but in
  celebration of our GV500 Gravel Collection\, we‚Äôll run it out on the
  gravel steeds. It‚Äôs 2 laps (about 28km)\, pace will be 2.6-3.0 w/kg
  depending how the blob is feeling. Not a race\, but enough to get the
  heart rate up before breakfast\, lunch or dinner wherever in the world
  you are.\n#kitunlock

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Move for Lex							 							
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:The Move for Lex workout honors avid Zwifter and cyclist Alexa
  Leary\, who was seriously injured in a bike crash in July 2021. \n\nLex
  was one of Australia‚Äôs top emerging junior triathletes at the time of
  her accident and is now facing months of rehabilitation. \n\nThe
  #moveforlex movement is all about moving for those who can't and we'd
  love to see a huge group moving for Lex here every Friday for a
  workout.\n\nFor more information on the Move For Lex movement visit
