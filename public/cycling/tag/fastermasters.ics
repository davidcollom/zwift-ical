SUMMARY:[Watopia] BMTR Faster Masters A/B/C Team Pursuit
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:From May through September\, the three category groups (A\, B\,
  C) may or may not include a Yellow Beacon Team Leader. \n\nTeam C will
  start first\, followed by Team B\, with Team A departing last. The goal
  is for the faster teams behind to catch Team C at or near the finish\,
  with all three teams holding their respective advertised pace. Starting
  time gaps may be adjusted during the season to ensure a close
  finish.\n\nThe pace efforts for each team are as follows:\n\n- Team C:
  2.5 to 3.1 watts per kilogram (w/kg).\n- Team B: 3.2 to 4.0 w/kg.\n- Team
  A: 4.1 to 5.0 w/kg.\n\nAll rides include a 30-minute Late Join period.
  During this time\, dropped riders can use the Late Join feature to
  rejoin. If you find that the team you selected is either too fast or too
  slow for your pace\, you can switch teams within the first 30 minutes of
  the start time of the team/category you would like to join..\n\nWe do not
  sweep during the first 30 minutes of a ride. If you fall behind for any
  reason during this time\, we recommend using the Late Join feature. We
  usually do not have designated sweepers (Red Beacon). After the first 30
  minutes\, if you get dropped and want to rejoin your team\, please send a
  message in the format HELP(X)\, where X is the number of seconds you are
  off the back (for example\, HELP5). If you reach out early\, one or more
  stronger riders may come to assist you.\n\nWe look forward to having you
  join us. It will be an excellent endurance adventure!\n\n**Connect With
