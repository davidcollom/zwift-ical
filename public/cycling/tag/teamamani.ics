SUMMARY:[Watopia] Team AMANI's Safari Ride
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Team AMANI's Safari Ride is an all category ride\, organized by
  Team AMANI as a training and community engagement tool. Come train with
  the up and coming talent from East Africa!\n\nWant to ride alongside some
  of the future stars of the gravel peloton? You've come to the right
  place! The routes may differ weekly and the rides will be periodically
  attended by the stars of  Team Amani as well as the future stars from our
  training facilities in Rwanda (Spoke Academy) and Kenya (the Amani
  House). We also welcome supporters of Team Amani to join and lead / take
  part.\n\nSo make sure to bring your A-game. There are 3 categories
  leaving from the start pen and everyone is able to sign-up according to
  their category and ride with the bunch. Challenge yourself on the
  segments we come across and make sure to set that PR!\n\nOur goal is to
  stay as a group during the warming up\, work hard at the climbs and
  regroup on the descents. We will break into a couple of different
  groups\, so find your pace and grab a wheel. If you're feeling strong\,
  pull a few friends across the flats to the hill.\n\nSo what is the AMANI
  Project? The AMANI project brings together initiatives aimed at enhancing
  access to the sport of cycling and creating opportunities for riders
  based in  East Africa. Our initiatives are:\n- Team AMANI \n- Migration
  Gravel Race & Safari Gravel\n- Amani House & Spoke Academy\n\nWant to
  learn more or support the cause?\n\nFollow us on our
