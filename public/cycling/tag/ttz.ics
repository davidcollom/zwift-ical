SUMMARY:[Watopia] "Russian Step - Hamster Style"
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:“Russian Step - Hamster Style” is a cadence game where your
  legs spin like a hamster wheel! Alternate between high-speed spins
  (100–120 RPM) and controlled strength efforts (60–75 RPM). It builds
  coordination\, pedaling efficiency\, and muscle activation. Stay focused
  and flow with the rhythm. Let’s spin like warriors!\nThe “Russian
  Step - Hamster Style” workout is perfect for those aiming to improve
  cadence agility\, pedaling efficiency\, and neuromuscular responsiveness.
  By alternating very high RPM efforts with slower\, strength-focused
  segments\, it trains your body to handle sudden changes in rhythm and
  builds muscular coordination. It’s an excellent session for riders of
  all levels who want to break routine\, sharpen their pedal stroke\, and
  have fun while training. It also keeps the mind engaged and legs
  responsive.\n⸻\n\n        •        Warm-up (10 min):\n        •
