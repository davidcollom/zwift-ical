SUMMARY:[New York] UK Armed Forces Cycling Community Race Night
LOCATION:New York
DESCRIPTION:We are back being "in the chop" is an Aussie expression that
  you won't read about in the UCI rulebook. It's one of the many nuances of
  bike racing that only comes with experience.\n\nSometimes when you're in
  a race and find yourself in the final break-away bunch you might get
  asked "are we in the chop?" or "are we chopping it?". This is referring
  to collusion between the lead riders to work together until the finish.
  Many times a break-away will be doomed in the final kilometres because
  everyone starts playing cat and mouse\, attacking\, sitting up\,
  etc.\n\nBut all that goes out the window in the last lap. This is
  generally where the group comes together and the final push begins.
  Working together goes out the window and is every man or woman for
  themselves for the final sprint to the line.\n\nThe Chop is a flat fast
  time-based handicap race. Do you always get blown out the back on the
  start of a multi grade race trying to hang onto the guy going with A
  grade pushing 5w/kg. Well not on The Chop. Released in Grades there are
  time splits from D to A with the intention of all coming together at the
  end for the big finish. Each Grade wears a different Zwift kit making
  each grade easily identifiable on who's wheel you want to catch if they
  go past.\n\nRaces happen on Tuesday evenings. We plan to add further
  races in the future. No single race has been the same. Many variables are
  at play on The Chop including course (which is generally a flat course)\,
  race numbers\, and the inevitable sandbaggers. It has been called a team
  time trail and cat and mouse but the real racers know it only as "THE
  CHOP". Do you have what it takes to take the glory?\n\n\nUKAFCC
