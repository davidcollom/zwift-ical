SUMMARY:[France] RO4H "Aaahh\, Thursday!" Social Ride
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride.\n\nThe
  RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride is a social group ride hosted by
  the Ride On 4 Health community. We foster a friendly\, casual\,
  supportive\, and respectful atmosphere that embraces everyone from the
  most seasoned Zwifter to the first-time group ride participant.\n\nThe
  pace varies depending on the terrain\, but the ride will have an overall
  average pace of around 18–20 MPH (27–32 KPH). The pace on the flats
  sections will be slightly faster in the peloton and be sub 2 W/KG on
  climbs. We typically ride mostly flat routes with only a few short
  hills\, if any. Sometimes we take on some slightly hillier routes for
  variety\, but most of our rides will be gently rolling to flat
  terrain.\n\nWe try to be a no-drop ride\, but ultimately\, this pace is a
  recovery pace for some and a great effort for others. You should be
  prepared to meet the average pace and strive to stay in the ride leader's
  peloton to benefit from the group draft effect. Being a social ride\, we
  don’t chase flyers — but flyers are free to fly. The “Aaahh\,
  Thursday!” Social Ride is certainly not a race.\n\nSweepers are
  available to assist those off the back. We do not want anyone to ride
  alone unless they choose. The sweepers will variably help riders bridge
  to the leader's peloton or form a second pace group. We do not want
  riders to ride alone unless they want to.\n\nJoin us for the RO4H
  “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride —you'll almost certainly break a
  sweat\, hear a few dad jokes\, and might even have fun.\n\nView the RO4H
