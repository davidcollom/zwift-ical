SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] GGCC Glasgow Green Cycle Club Thursday Training Ride
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:GGCC group rides are TRAINING events\, category C\, with a
  yellow beacon leader. The beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average
  wherever possible.\n\nPlease look out for our training rides 3 days a
  week\, every week - Tuesdays at 20.45 UTC\, Thursdays at 21.00 UTC and
  Saturdays at 11.30am UTC. Use #ggcc to search\, as in
  https://zwift.com/events/tag/ggcc\n\nThe Glasgow Green Cycle Club (GGCC)
  training rides are intended to provide a challenge for riders\, and are
  open to all timezones. You should ride as a group\, following the
  instructions of the beacon ride leader(s) for any sprints\, intervals and
  spicy segments\, regrouping after each when requested. All our group
  rides also have a closing minirace\, to start from behind the
  beacon.\n\nGGCC is a Glasgow based cycling club whose “in real life”
  (irl) club runs and training rides are always organized into pace
  groups\, which match the Zwift categories quite well. GGCC also has a
  good race pedigree and presence in Scotland\, and so we have organized
  this training ride series to suit what we believe is relevant to bike
  riders’ interests in performance and improvement in our club\, in other
  Glasgow clubs\, in Scotland and the UK. Racers will\, no doubt\, aspire
  to try our other events\, both our Monday 20.10 UTC Zwift races\, and our
  Friday 19.45 UTC TTs.\n\nAs we expect our club’s riders to be able to
  ride 50 miles at a 15mph average on our Sunday rides\, such steady riding
  members will be comfortable with Zwift Category C\, and in our various
  rides we cater for all abilities\, through the Zwift ABCD levels. Beacon
  leaders communicate via Zwift messaging (always) and/or Discord
  (sometimes) to vary the pace to allow for sprints\, intervals\, and
  optionally a mini-race towards the end of the rides\, with regrouping
  after each segment. Make as much use of drafting as you can\, for more
  effective sprinting and intervals.\n\nResults can be seen at the end of
  the ride on screen\, and we will\, in common with many other ride
  series\, publish your results on zwiftpower.com too\, based on each
  category.\n\nAll bikes and PUs are allowed\, but better not to use TT
  bikes (which don’t draft) on our group rides and races. Please add GGCC
  (X) to your Zwift name to allow your ride presence to be recognized\,
  where X is your desired ride category. Categories are related to your
  Functional Threshold Power (FTP)\; use your FTP and then divide by your
  weight in kg\, then pick the correct ride and group.\n\nC: 2 W/kg to 3
  W/kg FTP\; the beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average.\n\nPLEASE
  NOTE: Strava data for our rides must be open (not private or hidden).
  Please use a heart monitor so that we can monitor correlated power and
  heart rate to help assure fair riding.\nYou can use our Discord channel
  to talk to each other at https://discord.gg/UDhdEQA\nPlease see the GGCC
  Zwift page link at http://www.glasgowgreencycleclub.co.uk/ for
  more.\n\nFor more about specific Zwift courses for our events\, see the
  Zwift Companion schedule\, and also https://zwiftinsider.com/ where there
  is a wealth of information about all things Zwift.\n\n#ggcc
