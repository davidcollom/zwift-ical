SUMMARY:[Watopia] Move for Lex							 							
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:The Move for Lex workout honors avid Zwifter and cyclist Alexa
  Leary\, who was seriously injured in a bike crash in July 2021. \n\nLex
  was one of Australiaâ€™s top emerging junior triathletes at the time of
  her accident and is now facing months of rehabilitation. \n\nThe
  #moveforlex movement is all about moving for those who can't and we'd
  love to see a huge group moving for Lex here every Friday for a
  workout.\n\nFor more information on the Move For Lex movement visit
