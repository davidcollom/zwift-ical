SUMMARY:[Unknown] SZR Group Workout by Thyr
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:Ride with Mattias Thyr at Ovning.se in courtesy of SZR as he
  makes workouts for the one who cares and lets him.\nNudging the grit! The
  home of the unstructured GWOs. Here you got motivating rides together
  with friends. Skip plans\, just a exercise your pixels in a group is good
  for you\, both mentally and physically. Every 6th week we do a #maxtjuga
  (as we say in Sweden) or a the 20min FTP test together.\n\nOn his 8th
  years and +350 GWO:s he created and lead personally on Zwift. Come join
  and\, "Aim for the stars!\n\n• The workout is approximately 60 minutes
  long and can be done either fasted or fueled. I personally recommend lots
  of sugars.\n• The goal is to explore and feel the differences between
  various fueling strategies.\n• Remember to adjust your calorie intake
  to match your energy needs before during and after the session.\n• This
  workout is based on a percentage of your FTP (Functional Threshold
  Power).\n• Ensure your FTP is accurate and up-to-date for the best
  experience.\n• If needed\, perform an FTP Test a day before on Zwift
  prior the workout.\n• Use the Zwift Companion App or the Page Up/Down
  keys on your computer to adjust the FTP bias by 10% up or 25% down\,
  helping you dial in the effort level to suit your preferences.

SUMMARY:[Unknown] EVO CC Race Series
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO CC race series.  Start fast\, hang on in the
  middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to push your heart
  rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your training plan and
  watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as possible we have
  enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic disqualification
  on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate monitor\nRiding in an
  incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be disqualified in A\, B\, and
  C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D category. Race details and final
  results will be available at www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo

SUMMARY:[London] ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2. This is a group ride\,
  not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was
  founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW
  BEACON will pace between 1.7-1.9 on the ride \, with a possible increase
  of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for the whole ride
  will be sub 2 .\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our
  rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures
  that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back
  of the main group \, you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge
  the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride
  Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give
  you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are
  a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club \, but want you
  to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported
  and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader\, Sweeps and Ride
  Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not
  draft and will require you to push harder on the ride\, and in these
  instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes
  operate very similarly\, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be
  required for the ride and any chase backs to group .\n\nAll our rides
  have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have
  technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early
  stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the
  main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\n\nWe love to have a chat on our
  rides so join us on our dedicated discord channel for our sub
  2\nhttps://discord.gg/RJ3dhbjCEp\n\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the
  ride leader (or just in front on climbs)\, don’t let a gap form and the
  elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to fry
  anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE
  RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race

SUMMARY:[Richmond] ZHCC RUBBERBAND SOCIAL
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Want a 100% guaranteed no drop ride? want a 100% guarantee you
  can ride at your own pace? want a 100% guarantee you WILL stay in the
  group\,? want a 100% guarantee that the nasty fence will NOT kick
  you...........THEN LOOK NO FURTHER\, this is the ride for you.\nTry it -
  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT!\nOur ZHCC Rubber Band Club has the
  “rubber-band” activated which means that no matter what level you
  are\, you will be able to keep up and the group WILL STAY TOGETHER. The
  rubber band allows you to ride at your own pace\, slow or fast and you
  are guaranteed to stay in the group.\nThe ride speed will be slightly
  less than you would normally experience in a group ride due to the rubber
  band effect\, but we feel that's a small price to pay to allow all level
  of riders to remain together throughout the ride.\nIn this supportive
  environment it’s a great way of completing a ride knowing you wont get
  dropped or get dragged along by those naughty fliers!\nZHCC do not race
  each other\, we ride as one\, have fun and enjoy a group ride.\nThe ZHCC
  gang look forward to riding with you.\nSTRAVA :

SUMMARY:[Paris] EVO CC Sprint Race Series 
LOCATION:Paris
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO sprintrace series. Shorter more compact races
  for the rider looking for an effective high intensity race. Start fast\,
  hang on in the middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to
  push your heart rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your
  training plan and watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as
  possible we have enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic
  disqualification on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate
  monitor\nRiding in an incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be
  disqualified in A\, B\, and C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D
  category. Race details and final results will be available at
  www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] GGCC Glasgow Green Cycle Club Thursday Training Ride
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:GGCC group rides are TRAINING events\, category C\, with a
  yellow beacon leader. The beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average
  wherever possible.\n\nPlease look out for our training rides 3 days a
  week\, every week - Tuesdays at 20.45 UTC\, Thursdays at 21.00 UTC and
  Saturdays at 11.30am UTC. Use #ggcc to search\, as in
  https://zwift.com/events/tag/ggcc\n\nThe Glasgow Green Cycle Club (GGCC)
  training rides are intended to provide a challenge for riders\, and are
  open to all timezones. You should ride as a group\, following the
  instructions of the beacon ride leader(s) for any sprints\, intervals and
  spicy segments\, regrouping after each when requested. All our group
  rides also have a closing minirace\, to start from behind the
  beacon.\n\nGGCC is a Glasgow based cycling club whose “in real life”
  (irl) club runs and training rides are always organized into pace
  groups\, which match the Zwift categories quite well. GGCC also has a
  good race pedigree and presence in Scotland\, and so we have organized
  this training ride series to suit what we believe is relevant to bike
  riders’ interests in performance and improvement in our club\, in other
  Glasgow clubs\, in Scotland and the UK. Racers will\, no doubt\, aspire
  to try our other events\, both our Monday 20.10 UTC Zwift races\, and our
  Friday 19.45 UTC TTs.\n\nAs we expect our club’s riders to be able to
  ride 50 miles at a 15mph average on our Sunday rides\, such steady riding
  members will be comfortable with Zwift Category C\, and in our various
  rides we cater for all abilities\, through the Zwift ABCD levels. Beacon
  leaders communicate via Zwift messaging (always) and/or Discord
  (sometimes) to vary the pace to allow for sprints\, intervals\, and
  optionally a mini-race towards the end of the rides\, with regrouping
  after each segment. Make as much use of drafting as you can\, for more
  effective sprinting and intervals.\n\nResults can be seen at the end of
  the ride on screen\, and we will\, in common with many other ride
  series\, publish your results on zwiftpower.com too\, based on each
  category.\n\nAll bikes and PUs are allowed\, but better not to use TT
  bikes (which don’t draft) on our group rides and races. Please add GGCC
  (X) to your Zwift name to allow your ride presence to be recognized\,
  where X is your desired ride category. Categories are related to your
  Functional Threshold Power (FTP)\; use your FTP and then divide by your
  weight in kg\, then pick the correct ride and group.\n\nC: 2 W/kg to 3
  W/kg FTP\; the beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average.\n\nPLEASE
  NOTE: Strava data for our rides must be open (not private or hidden).
  Please use a heart monitor so that we can monitor correlated power and
  heart rate to help assure fair riding.\nYou can use our Discord channel
  to talk to each other at https://discord.gg/UDhdEQA\nPlease see the GGCC
  Zwift page link at http://www.glasgowgreencycleclub.co.uk/ for
  more.\n\nFor more about specific Zwift courses for our events\, see the
  Zwift Companion schedule\, and also https://zwiftinsider.com/ where there
  is a wealth of information about all things Zwift.\n\n#ggcc

SUMMARY:[London] The HERD Thirsty Thursday
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:The Herd's Thirsty Thursday (THTT) Dual Pace Social Group
  Ride\n\nThis group ride offers a dual pace in a social environment. The
  goal is to keep our rides entertaining with games and trivia\,
  educational with Zwift tips\, and on pace. This ride offer our
  traditional Cat “D” option or a slightly higher paced Cat “C”
  option.\n\nOur ride leaders’ goal is to keep to the advertised pace\,
  averaged over the course of the ride. However\, bear in mind that there
  are situations such as incline and descents that will affect the pace. To
  this\, we ask that you pay attention to the rider leader announcements
  and adjust your pace accordingly. Stay close to the yellow beacon where
  the draft is most effective. As is customary to all Herd rides\, we offer
  full Yellow (Ride Leader) and Red beacon (Sweeps) support.\n\nIf you find
  yourself wanting more of a challenge\, we encourage you to join our sweep
  team as they ride “sweep-tervals” (above advertised pace) to help
  bring riders back to the ride leader.\n\nRiding alone is not an option\,
  as Herd rides are geared to be inclusive and fun.\n\n#herd
