SUMMARY:[France] EVO CC Core Interval Ride [2.5-3.2w/kg avg]
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the Evolution Cycling Club [EVO] interval session.
  These rides are geared towards Zwifters that are looking for a varied
  content one hour session that can give them a full 5 zone workout. Draft
  in the group and stay zone 1-3\, or move to the front and join the
  sprints for zones 4 and 5 for short bursts. Average for this ride will be
  mid to high Category C (2.5-3.2 w/kg) but it may vary based upon
  course/leader. There will be keepers at the back\, and they will try hard
  to save dropped riders. The group is based upon high social interaction
  so bring your best banter. Use the mobile app or a keyboard to
  communicate in-ride.\n\n#evo
