  said "Warm-Up!!")\n\nThis is number two of two for the weekly warm-up
  rides. Use this group ride to warm-up for the faster paced C ride
  immediately following this ride\, or use it as a friendly recovery ride.
  Perhaps this is your fast ride! Then you are in the right place as we
  will challenge you here too!\n\nPace will start off around 1.8 w/kg and
  will work up to 2.2w/kg\, you will likely see up to 2.5w/kg on hills and
  climbs. With the goal AVERAGE pace being near 2.2 ish \;)\n\nThe Fence
  will be used if necessary to keep the group together\, however\, we love
  to let you loose for sprints and KOMs\, we just ask that you immediately
  fall back and regroup after you light it up.
  üî•‚ö°Ô∏èü™∞‚ö°Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüî•\n\nThere are no designated sweeps for this
  ride\, but we always have wheels to help. Please give a shout before you
  fall too far back.\n\nNew to our rides or to Zwift? Let us know\, so we
  can help you enjoy the ride.\nThe best place to hang-out in the ride is
  in the front 1/3 of the Yellow Beacons (Leaders) Peloton or Blob. This
  keeps you in the draft and at the advertised pace and involved with the
  group.\n\nCourses/Routes will change routinely\, if you have a route or
  badge you want to get\, let us know!!\n\nOur Discord is
  https://discord.gg/uyE2eUh4yE and all are welcome.\n\nActive Duty and
  Veterans please feel free to place (*USMeS*) after your name.\nFit for
