SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Escalation
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nEscalation features intervals that become
  harder as the workout elapses. Starting off at mainly sub-threshold
  intensity\, but progressing to very difficult 30/30s for the
  finale!\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC Coaching) holds a
  bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional Development and
  Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert level) Certified
  Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA Cycling
  certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe Sport
  Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is also the
  creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can be
  contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the
  FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and make the difficulty
  level of the workouts too high for your current fitness level. For more
