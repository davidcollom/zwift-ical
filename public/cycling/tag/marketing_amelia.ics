SUMMARY:[France] AATC Thursday Interval Workout 
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:WORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nMatt Dana of the Ann Arbor Triathlon Club -
  Group workouts make training so much more fun. The Ann Arbor Triathlon
  Club promotes the sport of triathlon in Southeast Michigan. We have all
  levels of Triathletes.  \n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in
  the starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts\,
  workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output.
  That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:
