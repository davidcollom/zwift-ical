SUMMARY:[Unknown] EVO CC Race Series
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO CC race series.  Start fast\, hang on in the
  middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to push your heart
  rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your training plan and
  watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as possible we have
  enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic disqualification
  on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate monitor\nRiding in an
  incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be disqualified in A\, B\, and
  C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D category. Race details and final
  results will be available at www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo

SUMMARY:[Paris] EVO CC Sprint Race Series 
LOCATION:Paris
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO sprintrace series. Shorter more compact races
  for the rider looking for an effective high intensity race. Start fast\,
  hang on in the middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to
  push your heart rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your
  training plan and watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as
  possible we have enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic
  disqualification on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate
  monitor\nRiding in an incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be
  disqualified in A\, B\, and C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D
  category. Race details and final results will be available at
  www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo
