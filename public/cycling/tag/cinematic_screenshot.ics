SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.
