SUMMARY:[Unknown] The HERD Thursday Social
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:New to Zwift\, just a little out of shape or recovering from
  injury? This is the group ride for you! All are welcome to join The Herd
  on this supportive and social event.\n\nRespect the leader's pace and
  ride with the yellow beacon. This is NOT A RACE! Stronger riders are
  encouraged to fall back and help sweep the riders struggling in the
  back.\n\nWE DO RUN THE FENCE! The fence is in place to ensure that new
  group riders don't get caught up with the flyers and have a bad
  experience. Bear in mind that the fence will move due to changes in speed
  on the inclines. We ask that you always ride with the yellow beacon.
  Please pay attention to messages from the ride leader regarding fence
  intervals and when to regroup.\n\nJoin us on Discord during the ride:

SUMMARY:[London] The HERD Thirsty Thursday
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:The Herd's Thirsty Thursday (THTT) Dual Pace Social Group
  Ride\n\nThis group ride offers a dual pace in a social environment. The
  goal is to keep our rides entertaining with games and trivia\,
  educational with Zwift tips\, and on pace. This ride offer our
  traditional Cat “D” option or a slightly higher paced Cat “C”
  option.\n\nOur ride leaders’ goal is to keep to the advertised pace\,
  averaged over the course of the ride. However\, bear in mind that there
  are situations such as incline and descents that will affect the pace. To
  this\, we ask that you pay attention to the rider leader announcements
  and adjust your pace accordingly. Stay close to the yellow beacon where
  the draft is most effective. As is customary to all Herd rides\, we offer
  full Yellow (Ride Leader) and Red beacon (Sweeps) support.\n\nIf you find
  yourself wanting more of a challenge\, we encourage you to join our sweep
  team as they ride “sweep-tervals” (above advertised pace) to help
  bring riders back to the ride leader.\n\nRiding alone is not an option\,
  as Herd rides are geared to be inclusive and fun.\n\n#herd
