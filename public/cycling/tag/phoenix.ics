SUMMARY:[France] Phoenix Rising - KNIGHT RIDE (banded)
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to PHOENIX RISING KNIGHT RIDE. This is a 60-minute
  banded ride where the whole group will stick together as long as you are
  pedaling. We generally ride on average 1.5 WKG. Some may have a higher
  WKG up front pulling the band\, you are welcome as well. Get a burn in
  those legs!!!!! We also have a sweep team at your disposal in case you
  fall out of the band. We are not racers but conquerors\, an inclusive and
  dedicated group striving to help riders achieve their goals through
  teamwork\, friendships and most of all unwavering support. Our rides are
  about the journey. We have a special bond with all those who join. We
  expect everyone to be treated with respect. Empathy and tolerance are
  appreciated as others will have differing views. Stay focused on what
  unites us: cycling and Zwift. Practice kindness. Please join our team
  every Thursday!\n\nFor more information on all our weekly events\, join
  our club Phoenix Rising on Zwift Companion.\n\nJoin us on Discord during
