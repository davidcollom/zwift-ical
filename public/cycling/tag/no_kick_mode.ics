SUMMARY:[Watopia] Team AMANI's Safari Ride
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Team AMANI's Safari Ride is an all category ride\, organized by
  Team AMANI as a training and community engagement tool. Come train with
  the up and coming talent from East Africa!\n\nWant to ride alongside some
  of the future stars of the gravel peloton? You've come to the right
  place! The routes may differ weekly and the rides will be periodically
  attended by the stars of  Team Amani as well as the future stars from our
  training facilities in Rwanda (Spoke Academy) and Kenya (the Amani
  House). We also welcome supporters of Team Amani to join and lead / take
  part.\n\nSo make sure to bring your A-game. There are 3 categories
  leaving from the start pen and everyone is able to sign-up according to
  their category and ride with the bunch. Challenge yourself on the
  segments we come across and make sure to set that PR!\n\nOur goal is to
  stay as a group during the warming up\, work hard at the climbs and
  regroup on the descents. We will break into a couple of different
  groups\, so find your pace and grab a wheel. If you're feeling strong\,
  pull a few friends across the flats to the hill.\n\nSo what is the AMANI
  Project? The AMANI project brings together initiatives aimed at enhancing
  access to the sport of cycling and creating opportunities for riders
  based in  East Africa. Our initiatives are:\n- Team AMANI \n- Migration
  Gravel Race & Safari Gravel\n- Amani House & Spoke Academy\n\nWant to
  learn more or support the cause?\n\nFollow us on our
  socials:\n\n@teamamani\n@spokeacademy\n\nCheck

SUMMARY:[Unknown] The HERD Thursday Social
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:New to Zwift\, just a little out of shape or recovering from
  injury? This is the group ride for you! All are welcome to join The Herd
  on this supportive and social event.\n\nRespect the leader's pace and
  ride with the yellow beacon. This is NOT A RACE! Stronger riders are
  encouraged to fall back and help sweep the riders struggling in the
  back.\n\nWE DO RUN THE FENCE! The fence is in place to ensure that new
  group riders don't get caught up with the flyers and have a bad
  experience. Bear in mind that the fence will move due to changes in speed
  on the inclines. We ask that you always ride with the yellow beacon.
  Please pay attention to messages from the ride leader regarding fence
  intervals and when to regroup.\n\nJoin us on Discord during the ride:

SUMMARY:[France] Endura Renegades
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Time for some gravel. On the only Zwift course that currently
  offers any advantage to gravel bikes\, we head to the Makuri Islands for
  the Chain Chomper circuit. Of course\, it’s up to you if you still want
  to go for an MTB or Road bike anyway\, that’s your call\, but in
  celebration of our GV500 Gravel Collection\, we’ll run it out on the
  gravel steeds. It’s 2 laps (about 28km)\, pace will be 2.6-3.0 w/kg
  depending how the blob is feeling. Not a race\, but enough to get the
  heart rate up before breakfast\, lunch or dinner wherever in the world
  you are.\n#kitunlock

SUMMARY:[France] RO4H "Aaahh\, Thursday!" Social Ride
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride.\n\nThe
  RO4H “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride is a social group ride hosted by
  the Ride On 4 Health community. We foster a friendly\, casual\,
  supportive\, and respectful atmosphere that embraces everyone from the
  most seasoned Zwifter to the first-time group ride participant.\n\nThe
  pace varies depending on the terrain\, but the ride will have an overall
  average pace of around 18–20 MPH (27–32 KPH). The pace on the flats
  sections will be slightly faster in the peloton and be sub 2 W/KG on
  climbs. We typically ride mostly flat routes with only a few short
  hills\, if any. Sometimes we take on some slightly hillier routes for
  variety\, but most of our rides will be gently rolling to flat
  terrain.\n\nWe try to be a no-drop ride\, but ultimately\, this pace is a
  recovery pace for some and a great effort for others. You should be
  prepared to meet the average pace and strive to stay in the ride leader's
  peloton to benefit from the group draft effect. Being a social ride\, we
  don’t chase flyers — but flyers are free to fly. The “Aaahh\,
  Thursday!” Social Ride is certainly not a race.\n\nSweepers are
  available to assist those off the back. We do not want anyone to ride
  alone unless they choose. The sweepers will variably help riders bridge
  to the leader's peloton or form a second pace group. We do not want
  riders to ride alone unless they want to.\n\nJoin us for the RO4H
  “Aaahh\, Thursday!” Social Ride —you'll almost certainly break a
  sweat\, hear a few dad jokes\, and might even have fun.\n\nView the RO4H
