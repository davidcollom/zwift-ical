SUMMARY:[Unknown] SZR Group Workout by Thyr
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:Ride with Mattias Thyr at Ovning.se in courtesy of SZR as he
  makes workouts for the one who cares and lets him.\nNudging the grit! The
  home of the unstructured GWOs. Here you got motivating rides together
  with friends. Skip plans\, just a exercise your pixels in a group is good
  for you\, both mentally and physically. Every 6th week we do a #maxtjuga
  (as we say in Sweden) or a the 20min FTP test together.\n\nOn his 8th
  years and +350 GWO:s he created and lead personally on Zwift. Come join
  and\, "Aim for the stars!\n\n• The workout is approximately 60 minutes
  long and can be done either fasted or fueled. I personally recommend lots
  of sugars.\n• The goal is to explore and feel the differences between
  various fueling strategies.\n• Remember to adjust your calorie intake
  to match your energy needs before during and after the session.\n• This
  workout is based on a percentage of your FTP (Functional Threshold
  Power).\n• Ensure your FTP is accurate and up-to-date for the best
  experience.\n• If needed\, perform an FTP Test a day before on Zwift
  prior the workout.\n• Use the Zwift Companion App or the Page Up/Down
  keys on your computer to adjust the FTP bias by 10% up or 25% down\,
  helping you dial in the effort level to suit your preferences.
