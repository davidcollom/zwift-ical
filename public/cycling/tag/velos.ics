SUMMARY:[Watopia] Poursuite de la Lanterne Rouge p/b Velos
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Looking for a fun and well supported social ride that will make
  you stronger? Then join us on Poursuite de la Lanterne Rouge! This event
  is great for confident D riders looking to step up to something a bit
  faster\, as well as experienced riders who want to test themselves at
  race pace. We ride together for 45 minutes at 23mph/38kph (2.3w/kg)\,
  have a KOM to conquer then a Sprint to warm the legs\, then we unleash
  our Red Beacon to step on the gas and - after a little head start to give
  our Lanterne Rouge a fighting chance - anyone game for a chase is free to
  fly. Three chase groups are offered with 3-6 minute deficits to close\,
  and you are guaranteed to get stronger with each attempt to catch! The
  Yellow Beacon leader will continue at the listed pace the full hour to
  help those who don’t fancy a chase finish in friendly company. Strong
  sweep support is available for anyone needing a wheel get back into the
  leader’s group.\nJoin our social group at: www.teamvelos.co.uk
