SUMMARY:[London] ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2. This is a group ride\,
  not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was
  founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW
  BEACON will pace between 1.7-1.9 on the ride \, with a possible increase
  of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for the whole ride
  will be sub 2 .\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our
  rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures
  that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back
  of the main group \, you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge
  the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride
  Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give
  you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are
  a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club \, but want you
  to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported
  and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader\, Sweeps and Ride
  Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not
  draft and will require you to push harder on the ride\, and in these
  instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes
  operate very similarly\, minimum draft so more watts (effort) will be
  required for the ride and any chase backs to group .\n\nAll our rides
  have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to rejoin if you have
  technical issues or you find yourself out of the group in the early
  stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you back into the
  main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\n\nWe love to have a chat on our
  rides so join us on our dedicated discord channel for our sub
  2\nhttps://discord.gg/RJ3dhbjCEp\n\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to the
  ride leader (or just in front on climbs)\, don‚Äôt let a gap form and the
  elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence ‚Äì We don‚Äôt like to fry
  anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE
  RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race
  Facebook page and our club on the companion app
