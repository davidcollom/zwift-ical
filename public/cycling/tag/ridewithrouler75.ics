SUMMARY:[Watopia] Ride with Rouleur
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:The weekly ride with the Rouleur Team. Each week we'll take on
  a 75km loop with the aim of completeing it as close to 2 hrs as we can. 
  Top marks for those who cross the line at exactly 2 hrs.  For most riders
  that will mean riding at between 2.5w/kg and 3 w/kg.  Stay as a group and
  it will be much easier.\n\nLook out for notifications on our Instagram
  @rouleurmagazine for information about the ride!  Join the Rouleur club
  on Zwift.
