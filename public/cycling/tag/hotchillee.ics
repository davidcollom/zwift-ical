SUMMARY:[Unknown]  Hotchillee Gain Train 
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:What is it?\nFirstly\, IT’S NOT A RACE but that doesn’t
  mean it’s an easy pace no-drop ride. It’s a paced “Category +”
  Hare and Hounds where you will be working predominately at the upper end
  of your category and hanging on for as long as you can in search of those
  gains.\n\nWhat are the paces?\nPaces are based on what the Ride Leader
  for each group will average and our leaders are pretty accurate - check
  on ZwiftPower afterwards.   Buffet Class (D+) Leader will average 2.4
  w/kg (departs at 1830)\nSecond Class (C+) Leader average 3.1 w/kg
  (departs at 1834)\nFirst Class (B+) Leader will average 3.7 w/kg (departs
  at 1836)\n\nPlease do not push the pace faster than this\, it ruins it
  for everyone - respect your Ride Leader\, do what they ask and don’t
  sandbag.\n\nWill the groups catch each other?\nUsually we aim for there
  to be a catch/merge in the final 5km or so but this does depend on the
  course.\nIf a merge does happen\, stronger riders are encouraged to
  “upgrade” to the faster group and\, if you’re struggling\, you can
  also “downgrade” to a slower one.\n\nWhat if I get dropped?\nSuck it
  up\, maybe find someone to spin home with and try to hang on a bit longer
  next week - just like a IRL chain-gang\, that’s how you get
  stronger.\n\nCan I push it at the end?\nWith about 3km to go\, your
  Leader will give a Go! Go! Go! shout and then\, if you want\, you can
  empty the tank.\n\n  What is Hotchillee?\nHotchillee is both an
  events company that organises some of the world's best cycling events and
  a cycling community. Check out the website for details of events\, rides
