SUMMARY:[Richmond] Coffee Lovers High Time for a Third Place
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Have you heard of Third Place? \n\nWe are sure that most of us
  are attracted to Zwift not only because of the sporting side\, but also
  because of its social component. The opportunity to do something healthy
  not as a statistician\, logging kilometres and hours pedalling\, but at
  the same time enjoying communication\, laughing\, learning new things\,
  sharing emotions\, memories and experiences. So that the hour does not
  drag on endlessly. That the sublime taste of the combination of sport\,
  joy and endorphins inspires you\, making you want to come back again.
  \n\nLet this event be your Third Place!
