SUMMARY:[Watopia] Mountain Massif's Mountain Goat Chase Race
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:This is a race with a difference. The slowest riders will start
  first with a time advantage over the fastest riders and race up to the
  top of the climb.\nTo make it fair\, each Categoryâ€™s advantage will
  decrease slightly\, over the next.\nThe objective is to ride hard and try
  and reach the top of the climb\, before being caught. This is a unique
  event because do you form a group and work together on the climb\, or do
  you strike out alone? These decisions will impact the
  outcome.\n\nRules:\nHeart Rate monitor required and Zwift Power for
  official results.\n\nMore information:\nFor more information check out
  the Mountain Massif website www.mountainmassif.com\, follow on
  Instagram\, Mountain_Massif and join our Zwift Club\, by clicking the
