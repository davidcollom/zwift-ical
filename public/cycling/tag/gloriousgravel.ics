SUMMARY:[Watopia] Glorious Cycling Club
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our second Glorious Cycling Club chase race. This is
  a fun a social handicap race where riders in each category (A\, B\, C\, D
  & E) will work together to chase/stay away from the other categories.
  With the help of a coach on Discord we'll get you working seamlessly
  together. There can only be one race winner\, however\, so eventually it
  will be every rider for themselves across the finish line! This race is
  not part of the Glorious Cycling Club racing league and so there are no
  league points available. It's just for fun!
