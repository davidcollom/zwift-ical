  Zwifters from a reputable Zwift Club\, this is your opportunity to ask
  questions about all things ZRL-related. You'll be able to learn useful

  from each day at various times and each will operate at the advertised
  paces (pace is based on your Zwift Pace Group).\n\nWHAT IS THE
  ZRL?\nIntroducing the spectacular Zwift Racing League (ZRL) - a

  round\, the ZRL stands as the undisputed heavyweight champion of online
  bike racing competitions worldwide.\n\nThis high-octane spectacle is

  stone unturned in delivering an unparalleled racing experience. But
  remember\, this race is an invitation-only affair\, so if you dare to
