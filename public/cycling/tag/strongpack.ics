SUMMARY:[Watopia] PACK 1.5 Stronger Together 
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:This PACK 1.5 beginner friendly event is aimed at Zwifters
  looking for a group ride experience at an average lap pace of around
  1.3-1.5w/kg.\n\nOn the flat\, the pace will be controlled to ensure the
  group draft effect is kept under tight control with a target of 1.5w/kg
  on any hills or upslopes. The Leader will text instructions as well as
  use discord voice chat as communication is the key to a good group ride.
  Sweepers will also be in operation to assist in helping the group stay

  same kit (unlocks at the finish) and you can optionally add (PACK) after
  your name to show support of the group. Please respect the pace set by
  the leader\, this is a group ride not a race.
