SUMMARY:[Watopia] Rocacorba Collective Workout Session
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Every Thursday\, our Training Members are guided by Coach Helen
  Bridgman. In case you missed it or want to have a taste of what and how
  we train\, we are making our workout available every Friday\, with no
  lead time. So put on some music and enjoy! You might even find one of our
  DSs on the road to chat with.\n\nSession : Zwift Race Attack Simulations
  & Sprints\n\nStart with a good warm up. 5 mins riding easy\, a 5 min ramp
  tho threshold and then 4 mins recovery.\n\nThe main working block is 4x3
  mins at top end threshold. At the start of each 5 min effort\, sprint for
  20s (erg mode off for the sprint so you can give max effort) before
  settling back into threshold for the remainder. 4 mins easy soft
  pedalling\, riding super easy to recover in between.\n\nAfter the final
  recovery\, we go straight into 20/40s. Turn erg mode off so you can give
  max efforts for each 20s and then spin super light to recover for
  40s.\n\nCool down\, ride easy for 7+ mins to finish.\n\nThis session is
  to simulate both the hard start at the beginning of an Zwift race\,
  attacks during races where itâ€™s a max effort followed by high a
  intensity effort\, before backing off to recover and then go again\, and
  then sprinting at the end of the race when your legs are fatigued.
