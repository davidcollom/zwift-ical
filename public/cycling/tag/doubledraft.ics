SUMMARY:[Watopia] Team AMANI's Safari Ride
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Team AMANI's Safari Ride is an all category ride\, organized by
  Team AMANI as a training and community engagement tool. Come train with
  the up and coming talent from East Africa!\n\nWant to ride alongside some
  of the future stars of the gravel peloton? You've come to the right
  place! The routes may differ weekly and the rides will be periodically
  attended by the stars of  Team Amani as well as the future stars from our
  training facilities in Rwanda (Spoke Academy) and Kenya (the Amani
  House). We also welcome supporters of Team Amani to join and lead / take
  part.\n\nSo make sure to bring your A-game. There are 3 categories
  leaving from the start pen and everyone is able to sign-up according to
  their category and ride with the bunch. Challenge yourself on the
  segments we come across and make sure to set that PR!\n\nOur goal is to
  stay as a group during the warming up\, work hard at the climbs and
  regroup on the descents. We will break into a couple of different
  groups\, so find your pace and grab a wheel. If you're feeling strong\,
  pull a few friends across the flats to the hill.\n\nSo what is the AMANI
  Project? The AMANI project brings together initiatives aimed at enhancing
  access to the sport of cycling and creating opportunities for riders
  based in  East Africa. Our initiatives are:\n- Team AMANI \n- Migration
  Gravel Race & Safari Gravel\n- Amani House & Spoke Academy\n\nWant to

SUMMARY:[Watopia] ZZRC GROOVY TRAIN - Rock n' Roll
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Groovy Train 2.5-2.7wkg. This is a group
  ride\, not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC
  was founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift
  .\n\nYELLOW BEACON will pace between 2.5-2.7 on the ride \, with a
  possible increase of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for
  the whole ride is as advertised\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on
  most of our rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a
  fence ensures that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of
  falling off the back of the main group \, you will need to pace well over
  group pace to bridge the gap and catch .\n\nOur rides do not allow the
  use of TT Bikes as they do not draft and will require you to push harder
  on the ride\, and in these instances our Sweeps will not be able to help
  you .\n\nMountain bikes operate very similarly\, minimum draft so more
  watts (effort) will be required for the ride and any chase backs to group
  .\n\nAll our rides have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to
  rejoin if you have technical issues or you find yourself out of the group
  in the early stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you
  back into the main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\nSweepers are not in
  operation on this ride so please consider using late join in the first 30
  mins or make a small group of your own.\n\nWe love to have a chat on our
  rides so join us on our dedicated
  discord\nhttps://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to
  the ride leader (or just in front on climbs)\, don’t let a gap form and
  the elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence – We don’t like to
  fry anyone\n\n3) Most important of all . . . HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE
  RIDE.\n\n#zzrc\n\nDon’t forget to join our ZZRC-We Pace Not Race
  Facebook page and our club on the companion app

SUMMARY:[Unknown]  Hotchillee Gain Train 
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:What is it?\nFirstly\, IT’S NOT A RACE but that doesn’t
  mean it’s an easy pace no-drop ride. It’s a paced “Category +”
  Hare and Hounds where you will be working predominately at the upper end
  of your category and hanging on for as long as you can in search of those
  gains.\n\nWhat are the paces?\nPaces are based on what the Ride Leader
  for each group will average and our leaders are pretty accurate - check
  on ZwiftPower afterwards.   Buffet Class (D+) Leader will average 2.4
  w/kg (departs at 1830)\nSecond Class (C+) Leader average 3.1 w/kg
  (departs at 1834)\nFirst Class (B+) Leader will average 3.7 w/kg (departs
  at 1836)\n\nPlease do not push the pace faster than this\, it ruins it
  for everyone - respect your Ride Leader\, do what they ask and don’t
  sandbag.\n\nWill the groups catch each other?\nUsually we aim for there
  to be a catch/merge in the final 5km or so but this does depend on the
  course.\nIf a merge does happen\, stronger riders are encouraged to
  “upgrade” to the faster group and\, if you’re struggling\, you can
  also “downgrade” to a slower one.\n\nWhat if I get dropped?\nSuck it
  up\, maybe find someone to spin home with and try to hang on a bit longer
  next week - just like a IRL chain-gang\, that’s how you get
  stronger.\n\nCan I push it at the end?\nWith about 3km to go\, your
  Leader will give a Go! Go! Go! shout and then\, if you want\, you can
  empty the tank.\n\n  What is Hotchillee?\nHotchillee is both an
  events company that organises some of the world's best cycling events and
  a cycling community. Check out the website for details of events\, rides
  and to get involved www.hotchillee.com

SUMMARY:[Richmond] ZHCC RUBBERBAND SOCIAL
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Want a 100% guaranteed no drop ride? want a 100% guarantee you
  can ride at your own pace? want a 100% guarantee you WILL stay in the
  group\,? want a 100% guarantee that the nasty fence will NOT kick
  you...........THEN LOOK NO FURTHER\, this is the ride for you.\nTry it -
  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT!\nOur ZHCC Rubber Band Club has the
  “rubber-band” activated which means that no matter what level you
  are\, you will be able to keep up and the group WILL STAY TOGETHER. The
  rubber band allows you to ride at your own pace\, slow or fast and you
  are guaranteed to stay in the group.\nThe ride speed will be slightly
  less than you would normally experience in a group ride due to the rubber
  band effect\, but we feel that's a small price to pay to allow all level
  of riders to remain together throughout the ride.\nIn this supportive
  environment it’s a great way of completing a ride knowing you wont get
  dropped or get dragged along by those naughty fliers!\nZHCC do not race
  each other\, we ride as one\, have fun and enjoy a group ride.\nThe ZHCC
  gang look forward to riding with you.\nSTRAVA :

SUMMARY:[Watopia] BMTR Faster Masters A/B/C Team Pursuit
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:From May through September\, the three category groups (A\, B\,
  C) may or may not include a Yellow Beacon Team Leader. \n\nTeam C will
  start first\, followed by Team B\, with Team A departing last. The goal
  is for the faster teams behind to catch Team C at or near the finish\,
  with all three teams holding their respective advertised pace. Starting
  time gaps may be adjusted during the season to ensure a close
  finish.\n\nThe pace efforts for each team are as follows:\n\n- Team C:
  2.5 to 3.1 watts per kilogram (w/kg).\n- Team B: 3.2 to 4.0 w/kg.\n- Team
  A: 4.1 to 5.0 w/kg.\n\nAll rides include a 30-minute Late Join period.
  During this time\, dropped riders can use the Late Join feature to
  rejoin. If you find that the team you selected is either too fast or too
  slow for your pace\, you can switch teams within the first 30 minutes of
  the start time of the team/category you would like to join..\n\nWe do not
  sweep during the first 30 minutes of a ride. If you fall behind for any
  reason during this time\, we recommend using the Late Join feature. We
  usually do not have designated sweepers (Red Beacon). After the first 30
  minutes\, if you get dropped and want to rejoin your team\, please send a
  message in the format HELP(X)\, where X is the number of seconds you are
  off the back (for example\, HELP5). If you reach out early\, one or more
  stronger riders may come to assist you.\n\nWe look forward to having you
  join us. It will be an excellent endurance adventure!\n\n**Connect With
