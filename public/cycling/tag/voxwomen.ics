SUMMARY:[France] Voxwomen Club Ride
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Join us for our community ride alongside our team of Voxwomen
  Ambassadors. The theme of our rides follows our mission as an
  organization: to inspire\, encourage\, and support. Settle in for 40-60
  minutes of riding\, you wonâ€™t get dropped as we have the rubberband
  feature in place to keep the group together - this means you can ride as
  hard or as easy as you want\, but will still be riding with the group!
  This ride is designed to get as many people together riding and enjoying
  the ride. Hope to see you on the roads of Zwift! \n\n
