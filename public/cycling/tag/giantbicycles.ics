SUMMARY:[New York] Team Giant on the NYC KOM After Party
LOCATION:New York
DESCRIPTION:Team Giant on the NYC KOM After Party is a group ride starting
  with a brief warm up and settling into a tight group ride at a 2.3-2.6
  wkg pace.  It's a chatty group ride\, we're supportive\, we welcome all\,
  and lots of banter is welcome.  Warming up for a race? Stick around as
  long as you like and get three laps of the Gotham Grind route as a
  group\, and then it's up to you. Push the NYC KOM for a PR\, or stay back
  with the leader and finish the route\, it's all up to you.
