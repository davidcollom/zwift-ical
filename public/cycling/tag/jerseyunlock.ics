LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Every Thursday\, our Training Members are guided by Coach Helen
  Bridgman. In case you missed it or want to have a taste of what and how
  we train\, we are making our workout available every Friday\, with no
  lead time. So put on some music and enjoy! You might even find one of our
  DSs on the road to chat with.\n\nSession : Zwift Race Attack Simulations
  & Sprints\n\nStart with a good warm up. 5 mins riding easy\, a 5 min ramp
  tho threshold and then 4 mins recovery.\n\nThe main working block is 4x3
  mins at top end threshold. At the start of each 5 min effort\, sprint for
  20s (erg mode off for the sprint so you can give max effort) before
  settling back into threshold for the remainder. 4 mins easy soft
  pedalling\, riding super easy to recover in between.\n\nAfter the final
  recovery\, we go straight into 20/40s. Turn erg mode off so you can give
  max efforts for each 20s and then spin super light to recover for
  40s.\n\nCool down\, ride easy for 7+ mins to finish.\n\nThis session is
  to simulate both the hard start at the beginning of an Zwift race\,
  attacks during races where it‚Äôs a max effort followed by high a
  intensity effort\, before backing off to recover and then go again\, and
  then sprinting at the end of the race when your legs are fatigued.

SUMMARY:[London] ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Pedal Party Sub 2. This is a group ride\,
  not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC was
  founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift .\n\nYELLOW
  BEACON will pace between 1.7-1.9 on the ride \, with a possible increase
  of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for the whole ride
  will be sub 2 .\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on most of our
  rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a fence ensures
  that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of falling off the back
  of the main group \, you will need to pace well over group pace to bridge
  the gap and catch .\n\nThis is where our awesome ZZRC sweeps and Ride
  Buddies will help you return to group using their draft. They will give
  you clear encouraging instructions to aid this process .\n\nOur crew are
  a caring bunch who dedicated a lot of hours to this club \, but want you
  to have the best ride experience on Zwift\n\nYou will be fully supported
  and encouraged throughout the ride by the Leader\, Sweeps and Ride
  Buddies .\n\nOur rides do not allow the use of TT Bikes as they do not
  draft and will require you to push harder on the ride\, and in these
  instances our Sweeps will not be able to help you .\n\nMountain bikes

SUMMARY:[Watopia] ZZRC GROOVY TRAIN - Rock n' Roll
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to our ZZRC Groovy Train 2.5-2.7wkg. This is a group
  ride\, not a race\, where we encourage riding together.\n\nIn 2015 ZZRC
  was founded and are one of the oldest established clubs on Zwift
  .\n\nYELLOW BEACON will pace between 2.5-2.7 on the ride \, with a
  possible increase of watts on inclines or sprints \, but the average for
  the whole ride is as advertised\n\nWe strongly promote group riding so on
  most of our rides we will use the Fence to help encourage that. Using a
  fence ensures that the ride is not over paced .\n\nIn the event of
  falling off the back of the main group \, you will need to pace well over
  group pace to bridge the gap and catch .\n\nOur rides do not allow the
  use of TT Bikes as they do not draft and will require you to push harder
  on the ride\, and in these instances our Sweeps will not be able to help
  you .\n\nMountain bikes operate very similarly\, minimum draft so more
  watts (effort) will be required for the ride and any chase backs to group
  .\n\nAll our rides have a 30 minute late join feature which allows you to
  rejoin if you have technical issues or you find yourself out of the group
  in the early stages of the ride. Using this feature SHOULD teleport you
  back into the main group with our YELLOW BEACON .\n\nSweepers are not in
  operation on this ride so please consider using late join in the first 30
  mins or make a small group of your own.\n\nWe love to have a chat on our
  rides so join us on our dedicated
  discord\nhttps://discord.gg/QdeS3PtXTX\n\nTOP TIPS\n\n1) Stay close to
  the ride leader (or just in front on climbs)\, don‚Äôt let a gap form and
  the elastic snap!\n\n2) Stay away from the Fence ‚Äì We don‚Äôt like to

SUMMARY:[Richmond] ZHCC RUBBERBAND SOCIAL
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Want a 100% guaranteed no drop ride? want a 100% guarantee you
  can ride at your own pace? want a 100% guarantee you WILL stay in the
  group\,? want a 100% guarantee that the nasty fence will NOT kick
  you...........THEN LOOK NO FURTHER\, this is the ride for you.\nTry it -
  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT!\nOur ZHCC Rubber Band Club has the
  ‚Äúrubber-band‚Äù activated which means that no matter what level you
  are\, you will be able to keep up and the group WILL STAY TOGETHER. The
  rubber band allows you to ride at your own pace\, slow or fast and you
  are guaranteed to stay in the group.\nThe ride speed will be slightly
  less than you would normally experience in a group ride due to the rubber
  band effect\, but we feel that's a small price to pay to allow all level
  of riders to remain together throughout the ride.\nIn this supportive
  environment it‚Äôs a great way of completing a ride knowing you wont get
  dropped or get dragged along by those naughty fliers!\nZHCC do not race
  each other\, we ride as one\, have fun and enjoy a group ride.\nThe ZHCC
  gang look forward to riding with you.\nSTRAVA :

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] GGCC Glasgow Green Cycle Club Thursday Training Ride
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:GGCC group rides are TRAINING events\, category C\, with a
  yellow beacon leader. The beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average
  wherever possible.\n\nPlease look out for our training rides 3 days a
  week\, every week - Tuesdays at 20.45 UTC\, Thursdays at 21.00 UTC and
  Saturdays at 11.30am UTC. Use #ggcc to search\, as in
  https://zwift.com/events/tag/ggcc\n\nThe Glasgow Green Cycle Club (GGCC)
  training rides are intended to provide a challenge for riders\, and are
  open to all timezones. You should ride as a group\, following the
  instructions of the beacon ride leader(s) for any sprints\, intervals and
  spicy segments\, regrouping after each when requested. All our group
  rides also have a closing minirace\, to start from behind the
  beacon.\n\nGGCC is a Glasgow based cycling club whose ‚Äúin real life‚Äù
  (irl) club runs and training rides are always organized into pace
  groups\, which match the Zwift categories quite well. GGCC also has a
  good race pedigree and presence in Scotland\, and so we have organized
  this training ride series to suit what we believe is relevant to bike
  riders‚Äô interests in performance and improvement in our club\, in other
  Glasgow clubs\, in Scotland and the UK. Racers will\, no doubt\, aspire
  to try our other events\, both our Monday 20.10 UTC Zwift races\, and our
  Friday 19.45 UTC TTs.\n\nAs we expect our club‚Äôs riders to be able to
  ride 50 miles at a 15mph average on our Sunday rides\, such steady riding
  members will be comfortable with Zwift Category C\, and in our various
  rides we cater for all abilities\, through the Zwift ABCD levels. Beacon
  leaders communicate via Zwift messaging (always) and/or Discord
  (sometimes) to vary the pace to allow for sprints\, intervals\, and
  optionally a mini-race towards the end of the rides\, with regrouping
  after each segment. Make as much use of drafting as you can\, for more
  effective sprinting and intervals.\n\nResults can be seen at the end of
  the ride on screen\, and we will\, in common with many other ride
  series\, publish your results on zwiftpower.com too\, based on each
  category.\n\nAll bikes and PUs are allowed\, but better not to use TT
  bikes (which don‚Äôt draft) on our group rides and races. Please add GGCC
  (X) to your Zwift name to allow your ride presence to be recognized\,
  where X is your desired ride category. Categories are related to your
  Functional Threshold Power (FTP)\; use your FTP and then divide by your
  weight in kg\, then pick the correct ride and group.\n\nC: 2 W/kg to 3
  W/kg FTP\; the beacon leader will ride to 2.5w/kg pace average.\n\nPLEASE
  NOTE: Strava data for our rides must be open (not private or hidden).
  Please use a heart monitor so that we can monitor correlated power and
  heart rate to help assure fair riding.\nYou can use our Discord channel
  to talk to each other at https://discord.gg/UDhdEQA\nPlease see the GGCC
  Zwift page link at http://www.glasgowgreencycleclub.co.uk/ for
  more.\n\nFor more about specific Zwift courses for our events\, see the
  Zwift Companion schedule\, and also https://zwiftinsider.com/ where there
  is a wealth of information about all things Zwift.\n\n#ggcc

SUMMARY:[Watopia] BMTR Faster Masters A/B/C Team Pursuit
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:From May through September\, the three category groups (A\, B\,
  C) may or may not include a Yellow Beacon Team Leader.¬†\n\nTeam C will
  start first\, followed by Team B\, with Team A departing last. The goal
  is for the faster teams behind to catch Team C at or near the finish\,
  with all three teams holding their respective advertised pace. Starting
  time gaps may be adjusted during the season to ensure a close
  finish.\n\nThe pace efforts for each team are as follows:\n\n- Team C:
  2.5 to 3.1 watts per kilogram (w/kg).\n- Team B: 3.2 to 4.0 w/kg.\n- Team
  A: 4.1 to 5.0 w/kg.\n\nAll rides include a 30-minute Late Join period.
  During this time\, dropped riders can use the Late Join feature to
  rejoin. If you find that the team you selected is either too fast or too
  slow for your pace\, you can switch teams within the first 30 minutes of
  the start time of the team/category you would like to join..\n\nWe do not
  sweep during the first 30 minutes of a ride. If you fall behind for any
  reason during this time\, we recommend using the Late Join feature. We
  usually do not have designated sweepers (Red Beacon). After the first 30
  minutes\, if you get dropped and want to rejoin your team\, please send a
  message in the format HELP(X)\, where X is the number of seconds you are
  off the back (for example\, HELP5). If you reach out early\, one or more
  stronger riders may come to assist you.\n\nWe look forward to having you
  join us. It will be an excellent endurance adventure!\n\n**Connect With

SUMMARY:[France] RO4H "Aaahh\, Thursday!" Social Ride
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the RO4H ‚ÄúAaahh\, Thursday!‚Äù Social Ride.\n\nThe
  RO4H ‚ÄúAaahh\, Thursday!‚Äù Social Ride is a social group ride hosted by
  the Ride On 4 Health community. We foster a friendly\, casual\,
  supportive\, and respectful atmosphere that embraces everyone from the
  most seasoned Zwifter to the first-time group ride participant.\n\nThe
  pace varies depending on the terrain\, but the ride will have an overall
  average pace of around 18‚Äì20 MPH (27‚Äì32 KPH). The pace on the flats
  sections will be slightly faster in the peloton and be sub 2 W/KG on
  climbs. We typically ride mostly flat routes with only a few short
  hills\, if any. Sometimes we take on some slightly hillier routes for
  variety\, but most of our rides will be gently rolling to flat
  terrain.\n\nWe try to be a no-drop ride\, but ultimately\, this pace is a
  recovery pace for some and a great effort for others. You should be
  prepared to meet the average pace and strive to stay in the ride leader's
  peloton to benefit from the group draft effect. Being a social ride\, we
  don‚Äôt chase flyers ‚Äî but flyers are free to fly. The ‚ÄúAaahh\,
  Thursday!‚Äù Social Ride is certainly not a race.\n\nSweepers are
  available to assist those off the back. We do not want anyone to ride
  alone unless they choose. The sweepers will variably help riders bridge
  to the leader's peloton or form a second pace group. We do not want
  riders to ride alone unless they want to.\n\nJoin us for the RO4H
  ‚ÄúAaahh\, Thursday!‚Äù Social Ride ‚Äîyou'll almost certainly break a
  sweat\, hear a few dad jokes\, and might even have fun.\n\nView the RO4H
