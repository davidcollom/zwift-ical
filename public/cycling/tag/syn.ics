SUMMARY:[Watopia] SYN Workout Hour
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Time to fire up those legs! Every Thursday the SYN Global
  Cycling Club brings you the SYN Workout Hour—a weekly session built to
  boost your fitness and keep you sweating with a smile. Each week we mix
  it up: sometimes it’s steady FTP-building grind\, sometimes it’s
  short sharp power blasts\, and other times it’s smooth aerobic work.
  Whatever’s on the menu\, you’ll come out stronger.\n\n60MIN NO DROP
  WORKOUT\nZwift keeps us together\, so you’ll hit your own FTP targets
  without getting left behind. Sessions are round 60 minutes of solid
  training\, warm-up to cool-down.\n\nUNLOCK THE SYNDICATE CLUB KIT\nFinish
  our High Intensity Sessions on Zwift and unlock the Inverted SYN Kit
  (black jersey\, white bib) in your garage\, so you can wear the colors of
  our cycling club in any other ride on Zwift.\n\nDISCOVER MORE IN THE SYN
  ZWIFT CLUB\nEnjoyed this ride? Feel free to join our Zwift Club (SYN
