SUMMARY:[Watopia] Mountain Massif's Mountain Goat Chase Race
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:This is a race with a difference. The slowest riders will start
  first with a time advantage over the fastest riders and race up to the
  top of the climb.\nTo make it fair\, each Category‚Äôs advantage will
  decrease slightly\, over the next.\nThe objective is to ride hard and try
  and reach the top of the climb\, before being caught. This is a unique
  event because do you form a group and work together on the climb\, or do
  you strike out alone? These decisions will impact the
  outcome.\n\nRules:\nHeart Rate monitor required and Zwift Power for
  official results.\n\nMore information:\nFor more information check out
  the Mountain Massif website www.mountainmassif.com\, follow on
  Instagram\, Mountain_Massif and join our Zwift Club\, by clicking the

SUMMARY:[Watopia] BMTR Faster Masters A/B/C Team Pursuit
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:From May through September\, the three category groups (A\, B\,
  C) may or may not include a Yellow Beacon Team Leader.¬†\n\nTeam C will
  start first\, followed by Team B\, with Team A departing last. The goal
  is for the faster teams behind to catch Team C at or near the finish\,
  with all three teams holding their respective advertised pace. Starting
  time gaps may be adjusted during the season to ensure a close
  finish.\n\nThe pace efforts for each team are as follows:\n\n- Team C:
  2.5 to 3.1 watts per kilogram (w/kg).\n- Team B: 3.2 to 4.0 w/kg.\n- Team
  A: 4.1 to 5.0 w/kg.\n\nAll rides include a 30-minute Late Join period.
  During this time\, dropped riders can use the Late Join feature to
  rejoin. If you find that the team you selected is either too fast or too
  slow for your pace\, you can switch teams within the first 30 minutes of
  the start time of the team/category you would like to join..\n\nWe do not
  sweep during the first 30 minutes of a ride. If you fall behind for any
  reason during this time\, we recommend using the Late Join feature. We
  usually do not have designated sweepers (Red Beacon). After the first 30
  minutes\, if you get dropped and want to rejoin your team\, please send a
  message in the format HELP(X)\, where X is the number of seconds you are
  off the back (for example\, HELP5). If you reach out early\, one or more
  stronger riders may come to assist you.\n\nWe look forward to having you
  join us. It will be an excellent endurance adventure!\n\n**Connect With

SUMMARY:[London] The HERD Thirsty Thursday
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:The Herd's Thirsty Thursday (THTT) Dual Pace Social Group
  Ride\n\nThis group ride offers a dual pace in a social environment. The
  goal is to keep our rides entertaining with games and trivia\,
  educational with Zwift tips\, and on pace. This ride offer our
  traditional Cat ‚ÄúD‚Äù option or a slightly higher paced Cat ‚ÄúC‚Äù
  option.\n\nOur ride leaders‚Äô goal is to keep to the advertised pace\,
  averaged over the course of the ride. However\, bear in mind that there
  are situations such as incline and descents that will affect the pace. To
  this\, we ask that you pay attention to the rider leader announcements
  and adjust your pace accordingly. Stay close to the yellow beacon where
  the draft is most effective. As is customary to all Herd rides\, we offer
  full Yellow (Ride Leader) and Red beacon (Sweeps) support.\n\nIf you find
  yourself wanting more of a challenge\, we encourage you to join our sweep
  team as they ride ‚Äúsweep-tervals‚Äù (above advertised pace) to help
  bring riders back to the ride leader.\n\nRiding alone is not an option\,
  as Herd rides are geared to be inclusive and fun.\n\n#herd
