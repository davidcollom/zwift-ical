SUMMARY:[London] Kinetic Group Ride
LOCATION:London
DESCRIPTION:Join us for the Kinetic Group Ride -- all trainers welcome --
  and sharpen your sprint skills on this disciplined social ride.  We will
  ride 50 minutes at a 2.5 pace with some sprints just for fun on laps 2\,
  4 and 5 of the London Classique Course.  We regroup after the sprints and
  use the fence to hold to the planned pace.  Feeling a bit edgy?  We have
  you covered with an optional after party when the ride ends at a faster
  pace for 10 minutes.  Keep up with news about the ride on the community
