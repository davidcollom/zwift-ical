SUMMARY:[Richmond] ZHCC RUBBERBAND SOCIAL
LOCATION:Richmond
DESCRIPTION:Want a 100% guaranteed no drop ride? want a 100% guarantee you
  can ride at your own pace? want a 100% guarantee you WILL stay in the
  group\,? want a 100% guarantee that the nasty fence will NOT kick
  you...........THEN LOOK NO FURTHER\, this is the ride for you.\nTry it -
  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT!\nOur ZHCC Rubber Band Club has the
  ‚Äúrubber-band‚Äù activated which means that no matter what level you
  are\, you will be able to keep up and the group WILL STAY TOGETHER. The
  rubber band allows you to ride at your own pace\, slow or fast and you
  are guaranteed to stay in the group.\nThe ride speed will be slightly
  less than you would normally experience in a group ride due to the rubber
  band effect\, but we feel that's a small price to pay to allow all level
  of riders to remain together throughout the ride.\nIn this supportive
  environment it‚Äôs a great way of completing a ride knowing you wont get
  dropped or get dragged along by those naughty fliers!\nZHCC do not race
  each other\, we ride as one\, have fun and enjoy a group ride.\nThe ZHCC
  gang look forward to riding with you.\nSTRAVA :

SUMMARY:[France] USMeS - Thursday Social - Late [C] 2.2 - 2.8w/kg
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the USMeS Weekly Social - Late ride. Yes\, we said
  ‚ÄúSocial\,‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt going to put in some
  work!! It just means we will try and have fun while we‚Äôre at it! It‚Äôs
  almost the weekend!! Let‚Äôs GO!!\n\nPlease follow the ride leader's
  instructions. The leaders will have the ability to utilize the Fence to
  keep the group together and it will be
  live.üî•‚ö°Ô∏èü™∞‚ö°Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüî• Late rejoin is available for the
  first 30 min. If you get dropped\, booted by the fence\, or just want to
  catch up\, drop out of the event and rejoin back to the Yellow Beacons
  group. We love to let you loose for sprints and KOMs\, we just ask that
  you immediately fall back and regroup after you light it up.\n\nThere are
  typically no planned sweeps for this ride\, and all are encouraged to
  help each other out. Please call out soon if you feel you need help
  (5-10sec is a good time to ask!! 20-30 sec\, you may not get much help.)
  Courses/Routes will change weekly.\n\nNew to our rides or to Zwift? Let
  us know\, so we can help you enjoy the ride.\nThe best place to hang-out
  in the ride is in the front 1/3 of the Yellow Beacons (Leaders) Peloton
  or Blob. This keeps you in the draft and at the advertised pace and
  involved with the group.\n\nCourses/Routes will change routinely\, if you
  have a route or badge you want to get\, let us know!!\n\nOur Discord is
  https://discord.gg/uyE2eUh4yE and all are welcome.\n\nActive Duty and
  Veterans please feel free to place (*USMeS*) after your name.\nFit for
  Duty Fit for Life!\n\nTo easily see all rides we offer\, please join our
  club thru your Companion App! Search US Military eSports. In addition\,
  we invite you to join our Strava Club and our FB Group by searching US
