SUMMARY:[France] Endura Renegades
LOCATION:France
DESCRIPTION:Time for some gravel. On the only Zwift course that currently
  offers any advantage to gravel bikes\, we head to the Makuri Islands for
  the Chain Chomper circuit. Of course\, it’s up to you if you still want
  to go for an MTB or Road bike anyway\, that’s your call\, but in
  celebration of our GV500 Gravel Collection\, we’ll run it out on the
  gravel steeds. It’s 2 laps (about 28km)\, pace will be 2.6-3.0 w/kg
  depending how the blob is feeling. Not a race\, but enough to get the
  heart rate up before breakfast\, lunch or dinner wherever in the world
  you are.\n#kitunlock
