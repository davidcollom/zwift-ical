  Rides. Each one is hosted/run by a participating club and will feature

  for Tuesdayâ€™s ZRL races.\n\nTHE AIM\nWith experienced ride leaders and
  Zwifters from a reputable Zwift Club\, this is your opportunity to ask
  questions about all things ZRL-related. You'll be able to learn useful
  course and team tactics and if you are new to ZRL - perhaps even find a
  team to race with too!\n\nThere are multiple Group Recon Rides to choose
  from each day at various times and each will operate at the advertised
  paces (pace is based on your Zwift Pace Group).\n\nWHAT IS THE
  ZRL?\nIntroducing the spectacular Zwift Racing League (ZRL) - a
  turbocharged online bike racing extravaganza that's rewriting the rules
  of competition. With a staggering 180 community divisions\, 1\,800
  electrifying teams\, and a whopping 14\,000 fierce racers per 6-week
  round\, the ZRL stands as the undisputed heavyweight champion of online
  bike racing competitions worldwide.\n\nThis high-octane spectacle is
  masterfully orchestrated by our powerhouse partners\, WTRL\, who leave no
  stone unturned in delivering an unparalleled racing experience. But
  remember\, this race is an invitation-only affair\, so if you dare to
  join the ranks of speed demons and thrill-seekers\, you'll need to hitch
  a ride with one of the esteemed existing teams. Fear not\, though\, for
  WTRL's website (www.WTRL.racing) is your portal to all the insider intel
  - schedule\, rules\, and even a team that perfectly aligns with your
