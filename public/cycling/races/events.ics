SUMMARY:[Unknown] EVO CC Race Series
LOCATION:Unknown
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO CC race series.  Start fast\, hang on in the
  middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to push your heart
  rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your training plan and
  watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as possible we have
  enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic disqualification
  on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate monitor\nRiding in an
  incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be disqualified in A\, B\, and
  C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D category. Race details and final
  results will be available at www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo

SUMMARY:[New York] UK Armed Forces Cycling Community Race Night
LOCATION:New York
DESCRIPTION:We are back being "in the chop" is an Aussie expression that
  you won't read about in the UCI rulebook. It's one of the many nuances of
  bike racing that only comes with experience.\n\nSometimes when you're in
  a race and find yourself in the final break-away bunch you might get
  asked "are we in the chop?" or "are we chopping it?". This is referring
  to collusion between the lead riders to work together until the finish.
  Many times a break-away will be doomed in the final kilometres because
  everyone starts playing cat and mouse\, attacking\, sitting up\,
  etc.\n\nBut all that goes out the window in the last lap. This is
  generally where the group comes together and the final push begins.
  Working together goes out the window and is every man or woman for
  themselves for the final sprint to the line.\n\nThe Chop is a flat fast
  time-based handicap race. Do you always get blown out the back on the
  start of a multi grade race trying to hang onto the guy going with A
  grade pushing 5w/kg. Well not on The Chop. Released in Grades there are
  time splits from D to A with the intention of all coming together at the
  end for the big finish. Each Grade wears a different Zwift kit making
  each grade easily identifiable on who's wheel you want to catch if they
  go past.\n\nRaces happen on Tuesday evenings. We plan to add further
  races in the future. No single race has been the same. Many variables are
  at play on The Chop including course (which is generally a flat course)\,
  race numbers\, and the inevitable sandbaggers. It has been called a team
  time trail and cat and mouse but the real racers know it only as "THE
  CHOP". Do you have what it takes to take the glory?\n\n\nUKAFCC

SUMMARY:[Paris] EVO CC Sprint Race Series 
LOCATION:Paris
DESCRIPTION:CATEGORY ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED FOR ALL EVO RACES!\n\nWhat is
  Category Enforcement? \n\nCategory Enforcement will prevent Zwifters from
  entering a category they are not eligible for.  Our goal is to increase
  fairness in racing.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Zwift checks a racer's past
  performance using VO2 max and FTP to determine their race category.\n-
  Racers can join a category at or above their category. For example\, if
  you are "C" category\, you can race in C\, B\, or A category. You will
  not be able to race in the D category and the option to join will be
  absent.\n\nWelcome to EVO sprintrace series. Shorter more compact races
  for the rider looking for an effective high intensity race. Start fast\,
  hang on in the middle\, then sprint for the win at the finish. Expect to
  push your heart rate to its maximum. Sprinkle a few of these into your
  training plan and watch your fitness grow.\n\nTo make racing as fair as
  possible we have enforced a few minor rules that will result in automatic
  disqualification on ZwiftPower.\n\nAll riders must wear a heart rate
  monitor\nRiding in an incorrect category.\n\nzPower riders will be
  disqualified in A\, B\, and C Podium. zPower is allowed in the D
  category. Race details and final results will be available at
  www.zwiftpower.com\n\n#evo
