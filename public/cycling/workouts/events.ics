LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Time to fire up those legs! Every Thursday the SYN Global
  Cycling Club brings you the SYN Workout Hour—a weekly session built to
  boost your fitness and keep you sweating with a smile. Each week we mix
  it up: sometimes it’s steady FTP-building grind\, sometimes it’s

  Whatever’s on the menu\, you’ll come out stronger.\n\n60MIN NO DROP
  WORKOUT\nZwift keeps us together\, so you’ll hit your own FTP targets
  without getting left behind. Sessions are round 60 minutes of solid
  training\, warm-up to cool-down.\n\nUNLOCK THE SYNDICATE CLUB KIT\nFinish
  our High Intensity Sessions on Zwift and unlock the Inverted SYN Kit
  (black jersey\, white bib) in your garage\, so you can wear the colors of
  our cycling club in any other ride on Zwift.\n\nDISCOVER MORE IN THE SYN

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] Macro to Micro
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nA zone 6 microburst workout with an
  initial longer effort to mimic the demands of a Zwift race start. ERG off
  for the micro efforts.\n\nWORKOUT DESIGNER\n\nShayne Gaffney (GC
  Coaching) holds a bachelors degree in Health Science in Professional
  Development and Advanced Patient Care\, is a USA Cycling Level 1 (expert
  level) Certified Coach\, a level 2 certified Training Peaks coach\, a USA
  Cycling certified power based training coach\, USA Olympic Committee Safe
  Sport Certified\, and a licensed physical therapist assistant.  He is
  also the creator of Zwift's "Build Me Up" Flexible Training Plan.  He can
  be contacted directly via  for any cycling or training related
  questions.\n\nFor more information on GC Coaching\, please visit
  www.gaffneycyclingcoaching.com\n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line
  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

  makes workouts for the one who cares and lets him.\nNudging the grit! The
  home of the unstructured GWOs. Here you got motivating rides together
  with friends. Skip plans\, just a exercise your pixels in a group is good
  for you\, both mentally and physically. Every 6th week we do a #maxtjuga

  years and +350 GWO:s he created and lead personally on Zwift. Come join
  and\, "Aim for the stars!\n\n• The workout is approximately 60 minutes
  long and can be done either fasted or fueled. I personally recommend lots
  of sugars.\n• The goal is to explore and feel the differences between
  various fueling strategies.\n• Remember to adjust your calorie intake
  to match your energy needs before during and after the session.\n• This
  workout is based on a percentage of your FTP (Functional Threshold
  Power).\n• Ensure your FTP is accurate and up-to-date for the best
  experience.\n• If needed\, perform an FTP Test a day before on Zwift
  prior the workout.\n• Use the Zwift Companion App or the Page Up/Down
  keys on your computer to adjust the FTP bias by 10% up or 25% down\,
  helping you dial in the effort level to suit your preferences.

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Rocacorba Collective Workout Session
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:Every Thursday\, our Training Members are guided by Coach Helen
  Bridgman. In case you missed it or want to have a taste of what and how
  we train\, we are making our workout available every Friday\, with no
  lead time. So put on some music and enjoy! You might even find one of our
  DSs on the road to chat with.\n\nSession : Zwift Race Attack Simulations
  & Sprints\n\nStart with a good warm up. 5 mins riding easy\, a 5 min ramp
  tho threshold and then 4 mins recovery.\n\nThe main working block is 4x3
  mins at top end threshold. At the start of each 5 min effort\, sprint for
  20s (erg mode off for the sprint so you can give max effort) before
  settling back into threshold for the remainder. 4 mins easy soft
  pedalling\, riding super easy to recover in between.\n\nAfter the final
  recovery\, we go straight into 20/40s. Turn erg mode off so you can give
  max efforts for each 20s and then spin super light to recover for
  40s.\n\nCool down\, ride easy for 7+ mins to finish.\n\nThis session is
  to simulate both the hard start at the beginning of an Zwift race\,
  attacks during races where it’s a max effort followed by high a
  intensity effort\, before backing off to recover and then go again\, and
  then sprinting at the end of the race when your legs are fatigued.

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Innsbuck] The Grind Finale
LOCATION:Innsbuck
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nThis session aims to replicate the
  demands of a mountain bike ride / event. \n\nMountain biking generally
  involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so
  plenty of surges and time spent being over geared! We also spend a lot of
  time on and off the power\, so short spells going  hard to get over an
  obstacle\, followed by a freewheel or very low power on a descent or
  little dip.\n\nWe touch upon all of these aspects in todays session\, as
  we start off alternating every 30 seconds between riding hard at a low
  cadence\, and riding easy - as if we are riding through an undulating
  single track. Then we make a ramp in effort\, which finishes with a 30
  second near max effort up a steep\, rocky banking!\n\nWORKOUT
  DESIGNER\n\nMatt Rowe - Heavily involved in cycling for the past 25
  years\, Matt represented Great Britain at the Junior World Championships
  before graduating to the pro ranks. Matt draws on his extensive race
  experience to help amateur cyclists around the world achieve their
  personal goals. \n\nABOUT GROUP WORKOUTS\n\nZwifters line up in the
  starting area just like a normal event and once the event starts\,
  workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power output.

  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop. \n\nWe highly recommend doing one of the

  up in the starting area just like a normal event and once the event
  starts\, workout mode begins. Everyone stays together regardless of power
  output. That's right\, if you're outputting 100W and another Zwifter is
  outputting 400W you will stay in exactly the same position relative to
  each other. Only if you stop pedaling and fall 6 meters behind the group
  will the rubber-banding stop.\n\nHELPFUL HINT\n\nWe highly recommend
  doing one of the FTP tests as the estimated FTP can be inaccurate and
  make the difficulty level of the workouts too high for your current
  fitness level. \n\nFor more info on FTP go to:

SUMMARY:[Watopia] Power Check #2 - Power Punches
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:These four workouts are going to burn\, but that’s how
  you’ll boost your speed\, and know where to improve. Each workout
  features a Power Check that measures a different part of your power
  curve\, setting you up early for training success. In Zwift Camp:
  Baseline\, you’re rewriting the script on your limits because this
  season is going to be the best one yet. \n\n5-Second Power: measures that
  neuromuscular snap you need to punch past the pack when it matters
  most—think finish line kicks!\n\n1-Minute Power: great for gauging your
  repeatability with high anaerobic power output and holding a max-effort
  pace.\n\n5-Minute Power: breakaways on climbs are notorious for
  separating “pretty good” from “great”—see where your VO2 Max
  stacks up here.\n\n20-Minute Power: ideal for seeing how your speed and
  endurance match up—a threshold effort that should have you flirting
  with your limit.

SUMMARY:[Watopia] "Russian Step - Hamster Style"
LOCATION:Watopia
DESCRIPTION:“Russian Step - Hamster Style” is a cadence game where your
  legs spin like a hamster wheel! Alternate between high-speed spins
  (100–120 RPM) and controlled strength efforts (60–75 RPM). It builds
  coordination\, pedaling efficiency\, and muscle activation. Stay focused
  and flow with the rhythm. Let’s spin like warriors!\nThe “Russian
  Step - Hamster Style” workout is perfect for those aiming to improve
  cadence agility\, pedaling efficiency\, and neuromuscular responsiveness.

  segments\, it trains your body to handle sudden changes in rhythm and
  builds muscular coordination. It’s an excellent session for riders of
  all levels who want to break routine\, sharpen their pedal stroke\, and
  have fun while training. It also keeps the mind engaged and legs
  responsive.\n⸻\n\n        •        Warm-up (10 min):\n        •

SUMMARY:[Yorkshire] Ham Sandwich
LOCATION:Yorkshire
DESCRIPTION:ABOUT THIS WORKOUT\n\nHam Sandwich features sweet spot
  over/unders\, with 30/30s sandwiched in between.  The over/under
  intervals alternate between 2 min @88% FTP and 30 secs @110% FTP.  The
  30/30s up the ante a bit and alternate between 30 secs @130% FTP and 30
  secs @50% FTP.  Yes\, there are rest breaks\, but they are purposely
  short to keep the heart rate and metabolic demands up.  Better eat your
  sandwich quick before the bread gets soggy...\n\nWORKOUT
